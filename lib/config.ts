  // ----- How to connect to Browser Drivers -----------------------------------
  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  //
  // Protractor needs to know how to connect to Drivers for the browsers
  // it is testing on. This is usually done through a Selenium Server.
  // There are five options - specify one of the following:
  //
  // 1. seleniumServerJar - to start a standalone Selenium Server locally.
  // 2. seleniumAddress - to connect to a Selenium Server which is already
  //    running.
  // 3. sauceUser/sauceKey - to use remote Selenium Servers via Sauce Labs.
  // 4. browserstackUser/browserstackKey - to use remote Selenium Servers via
  // BrowserStack.
  // 5. directConnect - to connect directly to the browser Drivers.
  //    This option is only available for Firefox and Chrome.
  //
