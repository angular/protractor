==========

[Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor) is an end-to-end test framework for [Angular](http://angular.io/) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) applications. Protractor is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) program built on top of [WebDriverJS](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs). Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.

Compatibility
-------------

Protractor 5 is compatible with nodejs v6 and newer.

Protractor works with AngularJS versions greater than 1.0.6/1.1.4, and is compatible with Angular applications. Note that for Angular apps, the `binding` and `model` locators are not supported. We recommend using `by.css`.


Getting Started

Once you are familiar with the tutorial, youâ€™re ready to move on. To modify your environment, see the Protractor Setup docs. To start writing tests, see the Protractor Tests docs.
