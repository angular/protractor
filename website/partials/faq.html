  <h3>
    My tests time out in Protractor, but everything's working fine when running
    manually. What's up?
  </h3>

  <p>There are several ways that Protractor can time out - see the
    <a href="#/timeouts">Timeouts</a>
    reference for full documentation.</p>

  <h3>
    What's the difference between Karma and Protractor? When do I use which?
  </h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io">Karma</a> is a great tool for unit
    testing, and Protractor is intended for end to end or integration testing.
    This means that small tests for the logic of your individual controllers,
    directives, and services should be run using Karma. Big tests in which you
    have a running instance of your entire application should be run using
    Protractor. Protractor is intended to run tests from a user's point of
    view - if your test could be written down as instructions for a human
    interacting with your application, it should be an end to end test
    written with Protractor.

    Here's a
    <a href="http://www.yearofmoo.com/2013/09/advanced-testing-and-debugging-in-angularjs.html">great blog post</a>
    with more info.
  </p>

  <h3>Angular can't be found on my page</h3>

  <p>
    Protractor supports angular 1.0.6/1.1.4 and higher - check that your
    version of Angular is upgraded.
  </p>

  <p>
    The
    <code>angular</code> variable is expected to be available in the global
    context. Try opening chrome devtools or firefox and see if
    <code>angular</code> is defined.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I deal with my log-in page?</h3>

  <p>If your app needs log-in, there are a couple ways to deal with it. If your
    login page is not written with Angular, you'll need to interact with it via
    unwrapped webdriver, which can be accessed like
    <code>browser.driver.get()</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can put your log-in code into an <code>onPrepare</code> function,
    which will be run once before any of your tests. See this example
    (<a href="https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/spec/withLoginConf.js">withLoginConf.js</a>)
  </p>

  <h3>Which browsers are supported?</h3>

  <p>
    The last two major versions of Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Safari. See details at
    <a href="#/browser-setup"> Setting Up the Browser</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The result of <code>getText</code> from an input element is always empty</h3>

  <p>This is a
    <a href="http://grokbase.com/t/gg/webdriver/12bcmvwhcm/extarcting-text-from-the-input-field">webdriver quirk</a>.
    <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> elements always
    have empty <code>getText</code> values. Instead, try
    <code>element.getAttribute('value')</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>How can I interact directly with the JavaScript running in my app?</h3>

  <p>
    In general, the design of WebDriver tests is to interact with the page as a
    user would, so it gets a little tricky if you want to interact with the
    JavaScript directly. You should avoid it unless you have a good reason.
    However, there are ways of doing it.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can use the <code>evaluate</code> function on a WebElement to get the
    value of an Angular expression in the scope of that element. e.g.
  </p>

  <pre ptor-inline-code>by.css('.foo').evaluate('bar')</pre>

  <p>
    would return whatever <code ng-non-bindable>{{bar}}</code> is in the scope
    of the element with class 'foo'.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser with
  </p>

<pre ptor-inline-code>
browser.executeScript('your script as a string')
</pre>

  <h3>How can I get hold of the browser's console?</h3>

  <p>In your test:
  </p>

<pre ptor-inline-code>
browser.manage().logs().get('browser').then(function(browserLog) {
  console.log('log: ' + require('util').inspect(browserLog));
});
</pre>

  <p>
    This will output logs from the browser console. Note that logs below the
    set logging level will be ignored. WebDriver does not currently support
    changing the logging level for browser logs.
  </p>

  <p>
    See an example (<a href="https://github.com/juliemr/protractor-demo/blob/master/howtos/browserlog/spec.js">spec.js</a>)
    of using this API to fail tests if the console has errors.
  </p>

  <h3>How can I get screenshots of failures?</h3>

  <p>
    First, this is how you can take a screenshot:
  </p>

<pre ptor-inline-code>
browser.takeScreenshot().then(function(png) {
  var stream = fs.createWriteStream("/tmp/screenshot.png");
  stream.write(new Buffer(png, 'base64'));
  stream.end();
});
</pre>

  <p>
    The method to take a screenshot automatically on failure would depend on
    the type of failure.
  </p>

  <p>
    For failures of entire specs (such as timeout or an expectation within
    the spec failed), you can add a reporter as such:
  </p>

<pre ptor-inline-code>
jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new function() {
  this.reportSpecResults = function(spec) {
    if (!spec.results().passed()) {
      //take screenshot
    }
  };
});
</pre>

  <p>
    Note, you can also choose to take a screenshot in <code>afterEach</code>.
    However, because Jasmine does not execute <code>afterEach</code> for
    timeouts, those would not produce screenshots.
  </p>

  <p>
    For failures of individual expectations, you can override jasmine's
    addMatcherResult function as such:
  </p>

<pre ptor-inline-code>
var originalAddMatcherResult = jasmine.Spec.prototype.addMatcherResult;
jasmine.Spec.prototype.addMatcherResult = function() {
  if (!arguments[0].passed()) {
    //take screenshot
  }
  return originalAddMatcherResult.apply(this, arguments);
};
</pre>

  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/juliemr/protractor-demo/blob/master/howtos/screenshot/screenshotReporter.js">
      See an example of taking screenshot on spec failures</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I produce an XML report of my test results?
  </h3>

  <p>You can use the npm package jasmine-reporters@1.0.0 and add a JUnit XML
    Reporter. Check out this
    <a href="https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/spec/junitOutputConf.js">
      example (junitOutputConf.js)</a>. Note that the latest version of
    jasmine-reporters is for Jasmine 2.0, which is not yet supported by
    Protractor, so you'll need to be sure to use version 1.0.0.
  </p>

  <h3>How can I catch errors such as ElementNotFound?</h3>

  <p>
    WebDriver throws errors when commands cannot be completed - e.g. not being
    able to click on an element which is obscured by another element. If you
    need to retry these actions, try using
    <a href="https://github.com/juliemr/webdriverjs-retry">webdriverjs-retry</a>.
    If you would just like to catch the error, do so like this
  </p>

<pre ptor-inline-code>
elm.click().then(function() { /* passing case */}, function(err) { /* error handling here */})
</pre>
</div>
