  <h1> Getting Started </h1>

  <p>To get started quickly, begin with the
    <a href="#/tutorial">Tutorial</a> which provides a step by step overview
    of how to install Protractor, create test files, set up config files, and
    run tests.
  </p>

  <p>Protractor needs two files to run, the test or spec file, and the
    configuration file. For additional information, see
    <a href="#/api-overview">Working with Spec and Config Files</a>.
  </p>

  <p>When writing tests, keep in mind that Protractor is a wrapper around
    WebDriverJS. You may want to skim through the
    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs">WebDriverJS
      Users Guide</a> before writing any tests.
  </p>

  <p>The WebDriverJS API is based on promises. To learn more, check out
    <a href="#/control-flow">The WebDriver Control Flow</a>.
  </p>

  <p>To learn how Protractor, Selenium Server, and Selenium WebDriver work
    together, take a look at
    <a href="#/infrastructure">How It Works</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Once you are familiar with Protractor, it is recommended that you start
    using Page Objects. For more information see
    <a href="#/page-objects">Using Page Objects to Organize Tests</a>.
