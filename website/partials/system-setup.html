  <h1>Setting Up the System Under Test</h1>

  <p>Protractor uses real browsers to run its tests, so it can connect to
    anything that your browser can connect to. This means you have great
    flexibility in deciding what you are actually testing. It could be a
    development server on localhost, a staging server up on your local network,
    or even production servers on the general internet. All Protractor needs
    is the URL. There are a couple of things to watch out for!</p>

  <p>
    <strong>If your page does manual bootstrap</strong> Protractor will not be
    able to load your page using browser.get. Instead, use the base webdriver
    instance - <code>browser.driver.get</code>. This means that Protractor
    does not know when your page is fully loaded, and you may need to add a
    wait statement to make sure your tests avoid race conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>If your page uses <code>$timeout</code> for polling</strong>
    Protractor will not be able to tell when your page is ready. Consider using
    <code>$interval</code> instead of <code>$timeout</code>.</p>

  <p>If you need to do global preparation for your tests (for example, logging
    in), you can put this into the config in the <code>onPrepare</code>
    property. This property can be either a function or a filename. If a
    filename, Protractor will load that file with Node.js and run its contents.
    See the <a href="https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/master/spec/login">login tests</a>
    for an example.
