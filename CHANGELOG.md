## Features

- ([8b088fd](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/8b088fd6bf83696fd2ad294d8818e20894332693)) 
  feat(locators): Added a By.cssContainingText locator.

  This new locator find elements by css selector and inner text in response to the lack of
  ':contains' selector.

  Example: By.cssContainingText('ul .pet', 'Dog') will find all ul children with class 'pet'
  containing the text 'Dog'.

  feat(protractor): add the browser.setLocation method to perform in-page navigation

  Allow a faster way to navigate within the app. The current browser.get method forces the entire
  app to load every time you navigate to a new page. The proposed browser.setLocation method uses
  the same format as $location.url().

  fix(locators): using $().$$() should return an ElementArrayFinder

  Prior, $(foo).$$(bar) would return a promise which resolved to an array of WebElements. This is
  unexpected, since $(foo).$(bar) returns an ElementFinder, and
  element(by.css(foo)).element.all(by.css(bar)) returns an ElementArrayFinder. Fixed so things are
  more consistent.

  feat(pause): add the browser.pause method to enter a webdriver-specific debugger

  Warning: this is still beta, there may be issues. Usage: In test code, insert a `browser.pause()`
  statement. This will stop the test at that point in the webdriver control flow. No need to change
  the command line you use to start the test. Once paused, you can step forward, pausing before
  each webdriver command, and interact with the browser. Exit the debugger to continue the tests.

## Breaking Changes

  refactor(locators): moves scope in locators to last argument

  scope defaults to document, and is an optional argument so now be moved to the end. Came up from
  debugging and trying to use window.clientSideScripts.findInputs('username'); which failed.
  Refactored to match original intent.

  BREAKING CHANGE: anything relying on clientsidescripts should no longer pass
     element scope as first argument.

      Before:

      window.clientSideScripts.findInputs(document, 'username');

      After:

      window.clientSideScripts.findInputs('username', document);
      // or simply
      window.clientSideScripts.findInputs('username');

    Also, any custom locators using addLocator will now break since the
    arguments order has chnaged. To migrate the code follow the example below:

      Before:

      var findMenuItem = function() {
        var domScope = arguments[0];
        var myArg = arguments[1];
        // balh blah blah
      };
      by.addLocator('menuItem', findMenuItem);

      After:

      var findMenuItem = function() {
        var myArg = arguments[0];
        var domScope = arguments[1];
        // balh blah blah
      };
      by.addLocator('menuItem', findMenuItem);

  feat(runner): add beta support for using mocha as your test framework

  This change adds limited support for using mocha as the test framework instead of jasmine. Make
  the switch by using `--framework=mocha` on the command line or adding `framework: 'mocha'` to the
  config. Tests will be run using the BDD interface. The interface is adapted so that tests run
  asynchronously without needing to call `done()`.

  Note that there is currently no support for an assertion framework, so you will need to require
  whichever assertion framework you prefer. This means there is no adapter to make the assertions
  unwrap promises, so you will need to resolve promises yourself and run the assertions afterwards.

  feat(runner): add beta support for using mocha as your test framework

  To allow the user to customize their framework, the protractor runner will now wait
  until just before `onPrepare` to load the framework. This means that `jasmine` will
  not be available in global until `onPrepare`. For example, this means that requiring
  the jasmine-reporters module must be done inside onPrepare, since that module expects

## Features

- ([f8d0291](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/f8d02910340f54af92a8ed5fdd067fa03ca2cef8)) chore(version): update the version of dependency minijasminenode

  This is notable because in the newer 0.2.6 version of minijasminenode,
  ddescribe and iit are supported. These should be available after running
  an 'npm update'.

- ([6165023](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/6165023a9593f4f69fe342761b8b2d75923baf7a)) feat(runner): return a promise from runner.runOnce

  In some cases knowing when the runner has finished is a requirement (e.g. an async grunt task).

- ([33fa4a4](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/33fa4a43acfbe87f3a4d4c84fa93c5c20b3cca0c)) feat(locators): by model works for anything with a model, not just input

  Notably, by.model will now find selects and textareas.

  Closes #321.

- ([238bb74](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/238bb7429572f9a9f6620bf1317690f1ac825960)) feat(ignoresync): ignoreSynchronization now affects the behavior of browser.get

  Now, when ignoring synchronization, calls to browser.get are equivalent to calling
  browser.driver.get.

  Closes #306

- ([30c0ceb](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/30c0ceb3e2745d3bcc549f4d4963d9fade132e71)) feat(element) element.all exports an 'each' method

  This addresses selenium server shutdown in two ways
   - the node process will stay open until selenium has exited
   - if the user inputs to STDIN (e.g. press space) selenium will shut down gracefully

- ([e98f71e](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/e98f71ebd7778d5c77c41bbecc73e31f1aeca177)) fix(webdriver-manager): fix IEDriver install and running via windows

  Changed the binaries.ie.url function to return the correct URL for the IEDriverServer.
  Created the zip object in the win32 section to be able to decompress IEDriverServer.
  Added a function to normalize a command across OS and spawn it. It allows start the webdriver in win32.

  Breaking Change.
  As outlined in Issue #296, redoing the way the selenium/webdriver
  install and run helper scripts work. Now, the 'webdriver-manager' script
  will be available either locally or globally (depending on how protractor
  was installed). It replaced install_selenium_standalone and the 'start' script
  that was provided after install. Run `webdriver-manager update` to download
  new versions of selected webdriver binaries. Run `webdriver-manager start`
  to start the standalone server. In addition, this fixes issues with running
  the server starter in Windows, and allows automated downloading of the IEDriver.

  Thanks to kurthong and vipper for their PRs with windows fixes, which were
  very useful in preparing this.

- ([c579a1a](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/c579a1a01bae6798a87a5ca8915417775e1b6fb2)) feat(webdriver-manager): redo the script to run and install selenium/webdriver

  Breaking Change.
  Your old selenium/start script will continue to work, but install_selenium_standalone no longer exists.
  To do a clean update, remove the selenium folder. Then run
  `webdriver-manager update`

- ([a1c91a2](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/a1c91a29af5c1e1f35744462ca16ef4b33ad6c48)) fix(config): Make all file paths in config files relative to the config file itself

  Breaking Change
  Previously, onPrepare and specs were relative to the location of the config,
  but seleniumServerJar and chromeDriver were relative to the cwd when the
  test was called. If you were calling the tests from somewhere other than
  the same directory as the config location, you will need to change the paths of
  seleniumServerJar and/or chromeDriver.  Closes #222.


# 0.13.0

_Note: Major version 0 releases are for initial development, and backwards incompatible changes may be introduced at any time._

## Features

- ([ce5f494](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/ce5f494289c3750b84c6783339a14342a1b74f3d)) feat(element): element.all now has 'first' and 'last' methods

  Using the config option `chromeOnly` now enables running ChromeDriver directly,
  without going through the Selenium Standalone. The chromedriver binary should be
  available in your PATH, or should be specified with the config option
  `chromeDriver`.

- ([76c094a](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/76c094a3fa69511b0311011b0ef2c7343b8e655b)) feat(getLocationAbsUrl) - allows current url to be obtained on IE (and Chrome/Firefox)

  Custom locators can now be added using by.addLocator(name, script), where
  script is a self-contained snippet to be executed on the browser which returns
  an array of elements. Closes #236.

- ([c7bcc20](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/c7bcc20c07416237f69f7934d257b5ba5bfe8c1f)) chore(angular): update to angular 1.2

  Previously, the runner would throw an error if any one of the spec patterns did not
  match any files. Now it logs a warning in that case, and errors out only if there
  are no found files in any spec patterns. Closes #260

- ([f3b3fdb](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/f3b3fdbcbc8fe4f3c5915ef0f6eb7c89e339a62e)) fix(element): fix an error where all.then() wasn't calling callbacks.

  When errors with messages matching /timeout/ were created, Protractor
  clears the control flow so that the remainder of the tasks scheduled
  for that spec don't bleed over into the next spec. This was messing up
  the promises used in the runner, since they are also webdriver promises.
  Long term, the runner should _not_ use webdriver promises. For now, fix by
  having the runner resolve promises directly rather than through chaining,
  and add a TODO to use promises which aren't connected to WebDriver's
  control flow in the runner.

  Closes #214.

# 0.12.0

_Note: Major version 0 releases are for initial development, and backwards incompatible changes may be introduced at any time._

This change introduces major syntax updates. Using the new syntax is recommeded, but the old version is still supported for now. Note also that the test application, docs, and example tests have been updated.

## Features

- ([a2cd6c8](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/a2cd6c8baf242a81c4efea1f55249d597de95329)) feat(syntax): big syntax reboot, expose global $, $$, element, and by

In an effort to make tests more readable and clear, a few more global variables
will now be exported.

`browser` is an instance of protractor. This was previously accessed using
`protractor.getInstance`.

`by` is a collection of element locators. Previously, this was `protractor.By`.

`$` is a shortcut for getting elements by css. `$('.foo')` === `element(by.css('.foo'))`

All changes should be backwards incompatible, as tested with the new 'backwardscompat'
tests.

## Bug fixes

- ([8c87ae6](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/8c87ae6b430479445744a2f5c8eaca7f5f03d61d)) fix(onPrepare): onPrepare with a string argument should resolve from the config directory

onPrepare can take a string, which is a filename containing a script to load adn execute
before any tests run. This fixes the string to resolve the filename relative to the
config file, instead of relative to the current working directory where protractor
is called.

## Features

- ([02cb819](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/02cb8199d89c6645d0bc9dbb39e5cb27517bfaf3)) feat(cli): allow passing params directly to your test

Adds a config object 'params' which is passed directly
to instances of protractor. 'params' may contain nested
objects, and can be changed via the command line as:

  --params.login.user 'Joe' --params.login.password 'abc'

This change also switches to using optimist to parse
command line flags for more flexibility and better usage
documentation. Closes #32.

- ([c025ddb](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/c025ddbe617b977908db509f365cc882924b196f)) feat(findElements): $ & $$ shortcuts.

Introducing the $ shortcut method for finding a single element by css
without having to call protractor.By.css.  Additionally $$ for finding
all elements by css.

Examples:
- ptor.$('.some .selector')
- ptor.$$('.some .selector')

- ([7d74184](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/7d7418411ea4a9d696855f755899161ecb36818d)) feat(explorer): add an interactive element explorer

When debugging or first writing test suites, you may find it helpful to
try out Protractor commands without starting up the entire test suite. You can
do this with the element explorer. This change introduces a first version
of the element explorer. Closes #107

## Bug Fixes

- ([e45ceaa](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/e45ceaae825cce0ec69580b8f6e93d102d4d61f1)) fix(repeaters): allow finding all rows of a repeater

Now, finding an element with the strategy 'protractor.By.repeater()' returns
a promise which will resolve to an array of WebElements, where each WebElement
is a row in the repeater. Closes #149.

- ([b501ceb](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/b501ceb7b776a5d9f1c2659326577601d0fbce5a)) fix(findElements): Consistently include evaluate.

- ([c17ac12](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/c17ac12c2a213a7b6f8c236e81ba5cb2db542fd0)) fix(cli): allow running from command line without a config file

If all necessary fields are specified (e.g. seleniumAddress and at least
one spec), a config file shouldn't be necessary.

## Breaking Changes

- ([421d623](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/421d6232fe0b45ca1758afd634997da644f2e1db)) fix(repeat): use 0-based indexing for repeater rows

BREAKING CHANGE: Finding rows with protractor.By.repeater now
indexes from 0 instead of 1. This should be more familiar to most
modern programmers. You will need to edit existing tests. Closes #90.

Before:
```
// The fourth foo
ptor.findElement(protractor.By.repeater('foo in foos').row(4));
```
After:
```
// The fourth foo
ptor.findElement(protractor.By.repeater('foo in foos').row(3));

To improve the readability of error messages, when waitForAngular times out
it now produces a custom message. This should help clarify confusion

This onPrepare callback is useful when you want to do something with
protractor before running the specs. For example, you might want
to monkey-patch protractor with custom functions used by all the
specs, or add the protractor instance to the globals.
An example usage is shown in the spec/onPrepareConf.js file and its
associated spec.

The cli usage says:
> USAGE: protractor configFile [options]
However, the options passed as argument are merged into the default
configuration as soon as the configFile is met in the args parsing
loop.
This fix merges the options in the default configuration only after
the loop, allowing to pass the options to the cli before or after,
or around the config file.

- ([a54abfb](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/a54abfbbfd3b13be5144e64e52a267c73d409a81)) Spec paths in configuration files are now resolved from the location of the spec file instead of the current working directory when the command line is run.



# 0.7.0

_Note: Major version 0 releases are for initial development, and backwards incompatible changes may be introduced at any time._

## Features

- ([7966912](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/796691205795d93fe12c998d20a58c8220ac6fb7)) Updating to Selenium 2.24.

- ([90f0a94](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/90f0a942b09faff5924674a20ce7705b6d685eba)) Instead of having tests run with the protractor runner need to require()
the protractor library, publish it to the global namespace. This insures
the instance of protractor used within the tests is the same as the
one used on the command line. Closes #36. Version bump for incompatible
API changes.

- ([cb373c9](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/cb373c99a7e33c5514bf1d2728a64f631ec8784c)) Adding glob matching to the spec files from the config. Closes #29.


## Breaking changes

- Now running on selenium 2.24. Requires updating WebDriverJS and the selenium standalone binary.

- The protractor runner now publishes `protractor` to the global namespace and sets up the Jasmine-WebDriver adapter. Tests run with this should no longer include

````javascript
// var protractor = require('protractor'); // No longer needed!
// require('protractor/jasminewd'); // No longer needed!

var ptor = protractor.getInstance(); // This should just work now.
````
