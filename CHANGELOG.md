  Breaking change for TypeScript:
  JasmineWD doesn't know anything about async/await, turns off JasmineWD if control flow was
  disabled.

  It will affect TypeScript tests that are using async/await and

  a. miss some await keyword in the test.(Previously, this might cause the
  test failed silently and be reported as pass), or

  b. use Promise in jasmine expect function

  **Before**
    ```ts
  await expect(getPromise()).toEqual(42);
    ```
  **After**
    ```ts
  expect(await getPromise()).toEqual(42);

# 5.1.0

#### Blocking proxy

Blocking Proxy is a new experimental feature in Protractor 5 and is behind the
`--useBlockingProxy` or `blockingProxyUrl`. See the
[lib/config.ts#L100](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/lib/config.ts#L100).
Other ways to start blocking proxy include using the
`--highlightDelay` and `--webDriverLogDir` flags See [lib/config.ts#L501](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/lib/config.ts#L501).

This adds two options, both of which are implemented with Blocking
Proxy. `--webDriverLogDir` will create a readable log with timing
information of webdriver commands in the specified directory.

`--highlightDelay` will pause before clicking on elements or sending keys.
While paused, the element that's about to be affected will be
highlighted.

#### Webdriver-manager

Webdriver-manager will now by default grab the latest versions of all binaries
(standalone, chromedriver, iedriver, gecko driver). Use the
`--versions.(binary name)` to pin to a specific version. Selenium standalone
3.0.1 has a bug which prevents it from working with any version of FireFox.
We have tested version 3.0.0-beta4 and know that it works with
FireFox 51, and we expect that the 3.0.2 release will also work.

#### TypeScript support

For jasmine users, in order to get all the type declarations that are used in
jasminewd2, you'll need to install `@types/jasminewd2` in addition to
`@types/jasmine` as dev dependencies.

  browser.angularAppRoot() will return a promise that resolves during the next step in the control
  flow.

  Also update to BlockingProxy 0.0.3, which allows changing rootSelector.

  I noticed I missed `waitForAngularEnabled` in #4037.  This commit fixed that.

  While I was at it I fixed a minor error where the promises implicitly created by
  setting `rootEl` and `ignoreSynchronization` weren't getting chained properly.

  Also fixed minor (so minor I think it was impossible to trigger) where
  browser.plugins_ could be undefined.

  Add test cases to reproduce the missing element race conditions possible in
  expected condition methods `visibilityOf`, `textToBePresentInElement`,
  `textToBePresentInValue` and `elementToBeClickable`.

  Add error handler `falseIfMissing` to all expected conditions that depend
  on the presence of an element.

  Expected conditions check the presence of an element before other checks,
  but when an element is removed exactly in the moment after the `isPresent`
  and before `isDisplayed` in `visibilityOf` the condition used to fail.

  This solution does not handle missing elements in (`isEnable`, `isDisplayed`,
  `isSelected`) and focused only on expected conditions (see #3972)

   Our initial plan to allow setting --disableChecks with an environment variable is insufficient,
  since the custom framework isn't even require()'d until after the config is parsed. This moves the
  unknown flag check into the runner, and gives frameworks a way to specify extra flags they accept.

  deps(update): update webdriver-manager to ^12.0.1 (#4042)

  Running `webdriver-manager update` will now by default grab the latest
  versions of all binaries (standalone, chromedriver, iedriver, gecko
  driver). You can continue to pin to a specific versions using the
  command line option. Example `webdriver-manager update --versions.chrome 2.20`.
  As of this release the latest versions are:

  - gecko v0.14.0
  - selenium-standalone 3.0.1 is the latest jar file; however, we recommend 3.0.0-beta4. See note
  below on Firefox support.
  - chromedriver 2.27
  - iedriver 3.0.0

   A note on FireFox support: Selenium standalone 3.0.1 has a bug which prevents it from working
  with any version of FireFox. We have tested version 3.0.0-beta4 and know that it works with
  FireFox 51, and we expect that the 3.0.2 release will also work.

  deps(jasmine): update jasmine to ^2.5.3 (#3960)

# 5.0.0

This version includes big changes around upgrading to selenium-webdriver 3.0.x.
See the [selenium-webdriver changelog](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/node/selenium-webdriver/CHANGES.md).

For the 5.0.0 release, we are still using the selenium standalone server 2.53.1
and recommend using Firefox 47. Firefox 48+ currently is not supported.

## Breaking Changes

- Minimum node version is now 6.9.x.
- When testing with Firefox 47, use the capability option `marionette: false`
  to use the legacy Firefox driver.

  Before:
  ```
  capabilities: {
    browserName: 'firefox'
  }
  ```

  After:
  ```
  capabilities: {
    browserName: 'firefox',
    marionette: false
  }
  ```

- We moved `@types/jasmine` to a devDependency. This means that Jasmine
  TypeScript users will need to include the `@types/jasmine` as a project
  dependency. This is to avoid conflicts for users that prefer mocha typings.

  After:
  ```
  "dependencies": {
    "@types/jasmine": "^2.5.38"
  }
  ```

- Selenium-webdriver methods removed: `WebDriver.prototype.isElementPresent`,
  `WebElement.prototype.getRawId`, `WebElement.prototype.getInnerHtml`, and
  `WebElement.prototype.getOuterHtml`.

  Before:
  ```
  let isPresent = browser.driver.isElementPresent(By.tagName('a'));
  let i = element(locator).getInnerHtml();
  let o = element(locator).getOuterHtml();
  ```

  After:
  ```
  let isPresent = element(By.tagName('a')).isPresent();
  let i = browser.executeScript("return arguments[0].innerHTML;", element(locator));
  let o = browser.executeScript("return arguments[0].outerHTML;", element(locator));
  ```

- Selenium-webdriver `ErrorCodes` have been removed.
- Adding cookies have been changed:

  Before:
  ```
  browser.manage().addCookie('testcookie', 'Jane-1234');
  ```

  After:
  ```
  browser.manage().addCookie({name:'testcookie', value: 'Jane-1234'});
  ```
- Removed `protractor.wrapDriver()`.
- You can no longer use `repl` command from within `browser.pause()`. Instead,
  use `browser.explore()` to directly enter the `repl`.
- Sending flags that are not recognized by the CLI throws an error. Since flags
  are a subset of all configuration options, these errors can be silenced with
  `--disableChecks`.
- Auto-detection of the root element. This is a breaking change because it
  changes the default root element behavior and removes the
  `config.useAllAngular2AppRoots` flag.  Modern angular apps now
  default to using all app hooks, and ng1 apps now check several places, notably
  the element the app bootstraps to.
- `sauceProxy` configuration field has been removed. Use `webDriverProxy`
  instead.

  Before:
  ```
  sauceProxy: 'http://sauceProxy'
  ```

  After:
  ```
  webDriverProxy: 'http://sauceProxy'
  ```

  feat(blockingproxy): Add synchronization with BlockingProxy. (#3813)

  This adds support for BlockingProxy behind the flag --useBlockingProxy.

  If set, the driver providers will start a proxy during their setup phase,
  passing the selenium address to the proxy and starting a webdriver client
  that talks to the proxy.

  Starting a proxy for each driver provider isn't strictly necessary. However,
  when we run with multiple capabilities it's easier to handle the logging if
  each Protractor instance has it's own proxy.

  Known issues:

  - Doesn't work with directConnect. You can get the address of chromedriver by
  mucking around in Selenium internals, but this probably changed for Selenium
  3.0 and I doubt it's worth figuring out until we upgrade.
  - Doesn't yet work with webDriverProxy (but it's an easy fix)

  refactor(browser): Remove protractor.wrapDriver() **breaking change** (#3827)

  Before:

  Users could create their own selenium driver instance and enable Protractor on
  it like so:

  ```js
  let capabilities = webdriver.Capabilities.chrome();
  let driver = new webdriver.Builder().usingServer(seleniumAddress)
    .withCapabilities(capabilities).build();
  let browser = protractor.wrapDriver(driver);
  ```

  Over the years, wrapDriver() has become increasingly broken as Protractor
  needs extra configuration options that wrapDriver() doesn't set.

  After:

  This method is removed. If users need a new browser instance, they can
  use `browser.forkNewDriverInstance()`.

  BREAKING CHANGE

  You can no longer use the `repl` command from within `browser.pause()`. Instead,
 use `browser.explore()` to directly enter the repl.

  deps(selenium-webdriver): upgrade to selenium 3 (#3781)

  Please see the [selenium-webdriver changelog](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/node/selenium-webdriver/CHANGES.md)

    - Removed method `WebDriver.prototype.isElementPresent`
    - Removed method `WebElement.prototype.getRawId`
    - Removed `getInnerHtml` and `getOutterHtml`

    - Dependency required for upgrade: use `jasminewd2@0.1.0`.
    - Selenium-webdriver requires node version 6+, updating travis and circle yml
      to use node 6 and 7.

    - Use `instanceof` selenium-webdriver error instead of error code.
      Selenium-webdriver error codes have been deprecated.

    - Use executor with selenium-webdriver from `lib/http`. Deferred executor has
      been deprecated.
    - Fix quitting `driverProviders`. When calling `webdriver.quit`, the control
      flow is shutdown and will throw an error.
    - Driver provider for direct connect has been modified to use `ServiceBuilder`
      and to call the `Service` to `createSession`
    - Note: Since this upgrade is still using FF 47, direct connect for Firefox is
      required to pass "marionette: false" in the capabilities. If you do not pass
      marionette to false, it will look for gecko driver in the PATH.
    - Added a TODO to support FF after 48+ with direct connect and gecko driver.

    - Updated `browser.manage().addCookie('testcookie', 'Jane-1234');` to use
      `browser.manage().addCookie({name:'testcookie', value: 'Jane-1234'});`

    - Updated debug commons for breakpoint updated to selenium-webdriver
      `lib/http` line 432.

    - For mocha tests, `selenium-webdriver/testing` uses the global `it` and
      cannot be reassigned as Protractor's global `it`. Some code has been
      copied / modified to `lib/frameworks/mocha` to make this work.

    - Capabilities for Firefox 47 requires setting marionette to false.
    - Setup still requires selenium standalone server 2.53.1 for Firefox tests.
      Firefox version used is 47.
    - Using selenium standalone server 3, with Firefox 48+ tests fail with gecko
      driver still do not work.
    - Selenium standalone 3 + FF 49 + gecko driver 0.11.1 does not work
    - Selenium standalone 3 + FF 48 + gecko driver 0.11.1 appears to work for a
      single test but after it quits, selenium standalone no longer works with
      firefox. When firefox 48 exists, logs show the following:

  Breaking change for TypeScript:
  Instead of importing globals like `browser` from `protractor/globals`,
  import from `protractor`.

  Before:

# 4.0.5

In this version, there are several small changes that affect TypeScript users
from the previous version 4.0.4. Here are some of the steps to resolve any
transpiling errors:

- In your package.json, use TypeScript 2.0.0. This will allow Protractor to use
  the `@types/node` and `@types/jasmine` installed in node\_modules.
- Remove `jasmine` and `node` from your `typings.json` since these types are
  already included via `@types`. If these were the only ambient typings
  installed, remove the `typings.json` file.
- If you still have a `typings.json` file, remove `typings` directory and
  install a fresh set of ambient typings with: `typings install`.

  fix(error message): do not crash of thrown error has made `stack` readonly (#3372)

# 4.0.0
This version includes some big changes, so we've decided to make it version 4.0!

- webdriver-manager is now it's [own NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdriver-manager), so you
can use it in your own projects. Protractor depends on it, though, so you shouldn't need to change
anything. However, because it is a new dependency you'll need to rerun `webdriver-manager update`.

- Protractor has TypeScript typings! See the [example](https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/master/exampleTypescript)
for details on how to use TypeScript in your tests.

## Breaking changes
- ([d932ad7](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/d932ad7e853c0bda5d45b478a5c0271d072b6794))
  chore(browser): rename protractor to browser and add a protractor namespace (#3214)

  * added wrapDriver method from the browser.ts and ExpectedConditions to the protractor namespace
  * imported selenium webdriver ActionSequence, Key, promise, Command, and CommandName to the
  protractor namespace

- Selenium Webdriver has deprecated getInnerHtml and getOuterHtml. You'll need to update your tests to
not use these methods.

- Protractor node module no longer has a config.json file. This is now handled in the webdriver-manager
node module and the files are also downloaded to the webdriver-manager/selenium folder.

  chore(configParser): allow non-glob file pattern (#2754)

  Cucumber allows line numbers to be passed in the filename in the form of
  `features/some.feature:42`. Glob expanding that results in an empty array and nothing being passed
  to the framework runner. This change checks for glob magic characters and only tries expanding it
  if found. Otherwise it just passes the filename verbatim. This was previously handled in [#2445]
  by stripping the line number first, but this is a more generic (non-cucumber) way to do it.
   Glob needed to be upgraded for this which resulted in a weird [npm 3 bug]
  (https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10637). Removing the rimraf package resolved this. It was only
  used to generate documentation which itself was removed a while ago.

  BREAKING CHANGE:

  Cucumber has been community maintained for a while, and in order to allow it to move faster, it is no longer part of the core Protractor library.

  chore(dependencies): update selenium-webdriver to 2.47.0

  Along with it, update `jasminewd2` to avoid situations where the control flow gets locked up and
  hangs.

  *Potential Breaking Change*:

  This is passing all existing Protractor tests, but there is a possibility that the changes to the
  control flow will cause some test flows to hang. If this causes issues, such as tests hanging or commands executing out of order, please revisit your use of functions affecting the control flow, such as `flow.execute`.

  See the selenium-webdriver changelog at https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/node/selenium-webdriver/CHANGES.md


## Bug Fixes

  fix(synchronizing): use the same control flow when ignoring sync

  Previously, the order of frames and tasks on the control flow was different depending on
  `browser.ignoreSynchronization`. This fixes the inconsistency by creating an empty task when
  ignoreSynchronization is true.

  Practically, this fixes the polling spec failing after the update to selenium-webdriver@2.47.0.


# 2.3.0

_This release contains updates which fix some issues with dependencies that had gotten stale. However, it does not yet contain an update to the selenium-webdriver dependency, because of potential breaking changes. That update will be done in a separate Protractor@2.4.0 release. See [issue 2245](https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/2245)._

  feat(debugger): make element explorer work with node 0.12.0

  Node has changed its debugger significantly in 0.12.0, and these changes are necessary to get it
  to work now.

  Specifically here are the key points to take note:

  * Before, the process continues running after `process._debugProcess(pid);` is called, but now,
  the process stops.
  > To over come this, the call to `process._debugProcess(pid)` is moved from protractor into the
  debugger client. Secondly, because the process stops after the call, we call `reqContinue` once
  the debugger connection is established, so that protractor continues into the first break point
  (for backwards compatibility, we added an extra empty webdriver command so that in earlier
  versions of node, protractor doesn't go past the first break point from the reqContinue).

  * Before repl provides '(foobar\n)' when an user inputs 'foobar'. Now it is just 'foobar\n'.
  > We will parse and strip away both the parenthesis and '\n' to support all versions of node.

  * Additionally (non-related to node 0.12.0), this change makes debugger processes fail fast if the
  port is taken.

## Breaking Changes

- ([34f0eeb](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/34f0eebd7e73b10e9b990caa06b63b6fd22b2589))
  fix(element): update to selenium-webdriver@2.45.1 and remove element.then

  This change updates the version of WebDriverJS (selenium-webdriver node module) from 2.44 to
  2.45.1. See the full changelog at
  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/node/selenium-webdriver/CHANGES.md

  To enable the update and remove confusion, this removes the `element().then` function unless there
  is an action result. This function is completely unnecessary, because it would always resolve to
  itself, but the removal may cause breaking changes.

  Before:
  ```js
  element(by.css('foo')).then(function(el) {
    return el.getText().then(...);
  });
  ```

  After:
  ```js
  element(by.css('foo')).getText().then(...);
  ```

  In other words, an ElementFinder is now no longer a promise until an action has been called.

  Before:
  ```js
  var el = element(by.css('foo'));

  protractor.promise.isPromise(el); // true
  protractor.promise.isPromise(el.click()); // true
  ```

  After:
  ```js
  var el = element(by.css('foo'));

  protractor.promise.isPromise(el); // false
  protractor.promise.isPromise(el.click()); // true
  ```

  Also, fixes `filter` and `map` to work with the new WebDriverJS.

  chore(config): remove deprecated `chromeOnly`

  This has been replaced with `directConnect`.

- Due to ([1159612](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/1159612ed76bb65612dbb2cc648e45928a251b10))

  Due to changes in how scheduling works on the control flow, specs
  in Jasmine1 will no longer wait for multiple commands scheduled in `onPrepare`
  or in the global space of the test file.

  Before:
  ```js
  onPrepare: function() {
    browser.driver.manage().window().maximize();

    // This second command will not finish before the specs start.
    browser.get('http://juliemr.github.io/protractor-demo');
  }
  ```

  To fix, return the last promise from onPrepare:

  After:
  ```js
  onPrepare: function() {
    browser.driver.manage().window().maximize();
    return browser.get('http://juliemr.github.io/protractor-demo');
  }
  ```

- Due to ([1159612](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/1159612ed76bb65612dbb2cc648e45928a251b10))

  Due to changes in WebDriverJS, `wait` without a timeout will now default
  to waiting for 0 ms instead of waiting indefinitely.

  Before:
  ```js
  browser.wait(fn); // would wait indefinitely
  ```

  After
  ```js
  browser.wait(fn, 8000) // to fix, add an explicit timeout
  ```

  This will be reverted in the [next version of WebDriverJS](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/node/selenium-webdriver/CHANGES.md#v2460-dev).

  feat(runner): add browser.getProcessedConfig method

  Now, instances of the `browser` object have a `getProcessedConfig` method which returns a promise
  that resolves to the current Protractor configuration object for the current runner instance. This
  means that if multiCapabilities are being used or tests are sharded, `getProcessedConfig` will
  return an object with the `capabilities` and `specs` property specific to the current instance.

  feat(launcher): allow multicapabilities to take array of promises

  Enables adding `getMultiCapabilities: function(){}` to your configuration file. The function
  returns either multiCapabilities or a promise of a multiCapabilities that is resolved after
  `beforeLaunch` and before driver set up. If this is specified, both capabilities and
  multiCapabilities will be ignored.

  Also allows specifying `seleniumAddress` in the capabilities/multiCapabilities object, which will
  override the global `seleniumAddress`. This allows you to use a different `seleniumAddress` per
  capabilities.

  Breaking Changes:
  `capabilities` can no longer be a promise. Use getMultiCapabilities if you need to return a
  promise.
  `seleniumAddress` can no longer be a promise. Likewise, use getMultiCapabilities.

  feat(timeline): add timeline plugin

  This plugin gathers test timeline information from the protractor test process, the selenium
  client logs (if available), and sauce labs (if available), and presents the output visually. This
  improves understanding of where latency issues are in tests. See #674

  Usage:

  Add the plugin to your configuration file:

  ```js
  exports.config = {
   plugins: [{
     path: 'node_modules/protractor/plugins/timeline/index.js',

      // Output json and html will go in this folder.
     outdir: 'timelines',

      // Optional - if sauceUser and sauceKey are specified, logs from
     // SauceLabs will also be parsed after test invocation.
       sauceUser: 'Jane',
       sauceKey: 'abcdefg'
     }],
   // other configuration settings
  };
  ```

  feat(plugins): add postResults hook for plugins

  Allows plugins to include a postResults function, which will be called after webdriver has been
  quit and the environment has been torn down. This step may not modify the contents of the test
  results object.

  Previously, caught errors were being interpreted as an empty object, causing lots of errors such
  as
  'Uncaught exception: Error while waiting for Protractor to sync with the page: {}' Now the error
  message will be displayed, and a more useful custom message will be thrown if the variable
  'angular' is not present or the root element is not part of the ng-app.

  See #1474

## Breaking Changes

  feat(launcher): allow multicapabilities to take array of promises

  Breaking Changes:
  `capabilities` can no longer be a promise. Use getMultiCapabilities if you need to return a
  promise.
  `seleniumAddress` can no longer be a promise. Likewise, use getMultiCapabilities.

  Why is this breaking change not causing a major version bump? This feature was
  not fully supported previously and we worked with all known users when making
  the change.

  fix(element): use the root element only to find the testability API, not scope searches

  In 9a8f45a a change was introduced which made Protractor's custom locators (by.binding, by.model,
  etc) use config.rootElement as the root for all their searches. This meant that
  config.rootElement was used both to specify how to get hold of Angular's injector as well as
  where to begin searching for elements. This does not work for all cases, for example if a dialog
  should be searched for elements but is a sibling, not a child, of ng-app.

  This reverts that change, and uses document as the parent for all searches. This is consistent
  with the behavior of the native locators by.id, by.css, and friends, which do not scope their
  search based on config.rootElement.

  chore(angular): upgrade angular to version 1.3.

  This change updates Protractor's test application from 1.2.9 to 1.3.0-r0.

  There is a significant behind-the-scenes change in the implementation of locating elements and
  waiting for the page to be stable. If you are updating your application to Angular 1.3, you may
  run into some changes you will need to make in your tests:

   - `by.binding` no longer allows using the surrounding `{{}}`. Previously, these
     were optional.
     Before: `var el = element(by.binding('{{foo}}'))`
     After: `var el = element(by.binding('foo'))`

   - Prefixes `ng_` and `x-ng-` are no longer allowed for models. Use `ng-model`.

   - `by.repeater` cannot find elements by row and column which are not children
    of the row. For example, if your template is
    `<div ng-repeat="foo in foos">{{foo.name}}</div>`
    Before: `var el = element(by.repeater('foo in foos').row(2).column('foo.name'))`
    After: You may either enclose `{{foo.name}}` in a child element or simply use:
    `var el = element(by.repeater('foo in foos').row(2))`

    should be largely transparent to users.

  fix(locators): locators should use the root element provided in config

  Previously, locators used 'document' as the root for their search. After this change, they will
  use the root element provided in the config file -
  `config.rootElement`. This will make sure behavior is correct if there are multiple angular apps
  on one page, and also enables the getTestability path, because that requires a root element under
  an ng-app.

  fix(protractor) fix stack traces for WebElement errors

  When angular/protractor@3c0e727136ab3d397c1a9a2bb02692d0aeb9be40 refactored `element()` into the
  ElementFinder object, the function lost some of its error handling.  This removed references to
  frames inside tests (`it()` blocks), making it hard to tell where the error was actually
  occurring.

  This commit fixes these problems, showing full stack traces for WebElement errors.

  This feature allows folks who are generating their spec files from a different language to see
  stack traces that use the line numbers from their sources before translation.

  This commit introduces a dependency on the `source-map-support` library.

  For general information about sourcemaps, refer:

## Bug Fixes

- ([56daa54](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/56daa54e2e269064bd44bc05ed0bbf2c44657ca8))
  fix(clientsidescripts): convert non-Error exceptions to Errors

  If any functions called by clientSideScripts throws a an exception that doesn't inherit from
  `Error`, the stack trace is completely unhelpful and the message is just "unknown error."  This
  commit wraps such errors into
  `Error` instances so that we have meaningful stack traces and the correct exception message. 
  (e.g. This is the common case when running dart2js code.  This commit gives us the Dart stack
  trace and exception message.)

  In addition, I've pushed the construction of the string to install into the browser into
  clientsidescripts.js.

  fix(locators): fix by.repeater finding all rows for IE

  Previously, element.all(by.repeater('foo in foos')) would find non-element nodes for
  ng-repeat-start elements, which could cause IEDriver to fall over if the test tried to get text
  from those nodes.

## Breaking Changes

- ([3c0e727](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/3c0e727136ab3d397c1a9a2bb02692d0aeb9be40))
  refactor(protractor): reorganize internal structure of elementFinder/webelement

  - Allow chaining of actions (i.e. `element(By.x).clear().sendKeys('abc')`)
  - first(), last(), and get(index) are not executed immediately, allowing
      them to be placed in page objects
  - Rework the way that elementFinder and wrappedWebElement is represented
  - Breaking changes:
    - element.all is chained differently
        ```
        Before: element(By.x).element.all(By.y)
        Now:    element(By.x).all(By.y)

        However, using element.all without chaining did not change,
          i.e. `element.all(By.x)`
        ```

    - Changed the way for retrieving underlying webElements
        ```
        Before: element(By.x).find(), element(By.x).findElement(By.y),
                  and element(By.x).findElements(By.y)
        Now:    element(By.x).getWebElement(),
                  element(By.x).element(By.y).getWebElement(),
                  and element(By.x).element(By.y).getWebElements(),
                  respectively
        ```
    - browser.findElement returns a raw WebElement so $, $$, and
        evaluate will no longer be available

  feat(launcher): Add support for maxSession

  - add support for maxSession and capability-specific specs
  - cleaned up launcher (refactored out taskScheduler.js)
  - Breaking change:
    - changed the config to shard test files; also sharding is specific to
  capabilities now
      ```
      Before: config.splitTestsBetweenCapabilities
      Now: config.capabilities.shardTestFiles or config.multiCapabilities[index].shardTestFiles
      ```

- ([9e5d9e4](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/9e5d9e4abb7d0928e6092a711fda527554994be7))
  feat(locators): remove deprecated locator APIs

  This is a **breaking change**. The following deprecated Locator APIs have been removed.

  - `by.input`
  - `by.select`
  - `by.selectedOption`
  - `by.textarea`

  `input`, `select`, and `textarea` can be replaced by `by.model`.

  `element(by.selectedOption('foo'))` can be replaced by
  `element(by.model('foo')).$('option:checked')`

  each webdriver command, and interact with the browser. Exit the debugger to continue the tests.

## Breaking Changes
- ([05eb42b](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/05eb42bb482c7cb36b48af1a86210afc442aa112))
  refactor(locators): moves scope in locators to last argument

  scope defaults to document, and is an optional argument so now be moved to the end. Came up from
  debugging and trying to use window.clientSideScripts.findInputs('username'); which failed.
  Refactored to match original intent.

  BREAKING CHANGE: anything relying on clientsidescripts should no longer pass
     element scope as first argument.

      Before:

      window.clientSideScripts.findInputs(document, 'username');

      After:

      window.clientSideScripts.findInputs('username', document);
      // or simply
      window.clientSideScripts.findInputs('username');

    Also, any custom locators using addLocator will now break since the
    arguments order has changed. To migrate the code follow the example below:

      Before:

      var findMenuItem = function() {
        var domScope = arguments[0];
        var myArg = arguments[1];
        // balh blah blah
      };

  feat(runner): add beta support for using mocha as your test framework

  This change adds limited support for using mocha as the test framework instead of jasmine. Make
  the switch by using `--framework=mocha` on the command line or adding `framework: 'mocha'` to the
  config. Tests will be run using the BDD interface. The interface is adapted so that tests run
  asynchronously without needing to call `done()`.

  Note that there is currently no support for an assertion framework, so you will need to require
  whichever assertion framework you prefer. This means there is no adapter to make the assertions
  unwrap promises, so you will need to resolve promises yourself and run the assertions afterwards.

  feat(runner): add beta support for using mocha as your test framework

  To allow the user to customize their framework, the protractor runner will now wait
  until just before `onPrepare` to load the framework. This means that `jasmine` will
  not be available in global until `onPrepare`. For example, this means that requiring
  the jasmine-reporters module must be done inside onPrepare, since that module expects
  jasmine to be available at the time it is loaded.

  Breaking Change.
  As outlined in Issue #296, redoing the way the selenium/webdriver
  install and run helper scripts work. Now, the 'webdriver-manager' script
  will be available either locally or globally (depending on how protractor
  was installed). It replaced install_selenium_standalone and the 'start' script
  that was provided after install. Run `webdriver-manager update` to download
  new versions of selected webdriver binaries. Run `webdriver-manager start`
  to start the standalone server. In addition, this fixes issues with running
  the server starter in Windows, and allows automated downloading of the IEDriver.

  Thanks to kurthong and vipper for their PRs with windows fixes, which were
  very useful in preparing this.

  When errors with messages matching /timeout/ were created, Protractor
  clears the control flow so that the remainder of the tasks scheduled
  for that spec don't bleed over into the next spec. This was messing up
  the promises used in the runner, since they are also webdriver promises.
  Long term, the runner should _not_ use webdriver promises. For now, fix by
  having the runner resolve promises directly rather than through chaining,
  and add a TODO to use promises which aren't connected to WebDriver's
  control flow in the runner.

In an effort to make tests more readable and clear, a few more global variables

`browser` is an instance of protractor. This was previously accessed using

`by` is a collection of element locators. Previously, this was `protractor.By`.

of the element explorer. Closes #107

## Bug Fixes

- ([e45ceaa](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/e45ceaae825cce0ec69580b8f6e93d102d4d61f1)) fix(repeaters): allow finding all rows of a repeater

Now, finding an element with the strategy 'protractor.By.repeater()' returns
a promise which will resolve to an array of WebElements, where each WebElement
is a row in the repeater. Closes #149.

- ([b501ceb](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/b501ceb7b776a5d9f1c2659326577601d0fbce5a)) fix(findElements): Consistently include evaluate.

When using findElements with a css locator, wrap the returned list of
elements with protractor specific functionality.

- ([c17ac12](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/c17ac12c2a213a7b6f8c236e81ba5cb2db542fd0)) fix(cli): allow running from command line without a config file

If all necessary fields are specified (e.g. seleniumAddress and at least
one spec), a config file shouldn't be necessary.

## Breaking Changes

- ([421d623](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/421d6232fe0b45ca1758afd634997da644f2e1db)) fix(repeat): use 0-based indexing for repeater rows

BREAKING CHANGE: Finding rows with protractor.By.repeater now
indexes from 0 instead of 1. This should be more familiar to most
modern programmers. You will need to edit existing tests. Closes #90.

Before:
```
// The fourth foo
ptor.findElement(protractor.By.repeater('foo in foos').row(4));
```
After:
```
// The fourth foo
ptor.findElement(protractor.By.repeater('foo in foos').row(3));
```

## Features

- ([881759e](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/881759e77462dc8e1001eb77008668ae6dc552cd)) feat(timeouts): add a unique error message when waitForAngular times out

To improve the readability of error messages, when waitForAngular times out
it now produces a custom message. This should help clarify confusion
for pages that continually poll using $interval. This change also adds more
documentation on timeouts. See issue #109.

- ([37e0f1a](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/37e0f1af196c3c0bf54dcddf0088a8c16602e5f2)) feat(install selenium): better communication in the install script

Adds better messages in the selenium server install script, and also
makes the script output a 'start' executable which can be used to quickly
start up the selenium standalone. *not yet windows friendly*. Closes #108.

- ([b32f5a5](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/b32f5a59169f1324271bd5abc09c17fcd9c4f249)) feat(config): add examples for dealing with log-in

Adds examples for how to log in when the login page is not written
in Angular. New examples are in spec/login.

- ([1b7675a](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/1b7675aab7846bee54117876887bfec07ce31745)) feat(cli): add an onPrepare callback to the config

This onPrepare callback is useful when you want to do something with
protractor before running the specs. For example, you might want
to monkey-patch protractor with custom functions used by all the
specs, or add the protractor instance to the globals.
An example usage is shown in the spec/onPrepareConf.js file and its
associated spec.

## Bug fixes

- ([256b21c](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/256b21cf8c744a200892e6b7f9172150b2f4fe8d)) fix(cli): allow passing the config file before the options

The cli usage says:
> USAGE: protractor configFile [options]
However, the options passed as argument are merged into the default
configuration as soon as the configFile is met in the args parsing
loop.
This fix merges the options in the default configuration only after
the loop, allowing to pass the options to the cli before or after,
or around the config file.

- ([6223825](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/62238252c7fc68c6a5941883f6a272e95997a8ff)) fix(jasminewd): allow use of custom matchers

Using jasmine.Matchers.prototype to generate the chained methods for
expect() calls is flawed because it does not pick up custom matchers
defined using addMatcher.  Instead, use either the matchersClass for
the current spec or from the environment.

- ([c22fc38](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/c22fc387bc0ef7a07371e023d39a6ce58dfa56c9)) fix(sync): getCurrentUrl and friends should sync with Angular first

getCurrentUrl, getPageSource, and getTitle should sync with Angular
before executing. Closes #92.

- ([dd06756](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/dd067561cf9fe0a765e98605b9ebdd8fbfef04d3)) fix(clientsidescripts): findElements and isElementPresent for protractor.By.select

- ([c607459](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/c60745945c6514e25403783eab3de5873e15758b)) fix (navigation): The defer label should appear before other window names,
not after.

- ([806f381](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/806f38113c675a26171776a559a20bf3899aa2cc)) Fix: findElements() and isElementPresent() now work for protractor.By.input.
Closes #79.

## Breaking changes

- ([881759e](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/881759e77462dc8e1001eb77008668ae6dc552cd)) feat(timeouts): add a unique error message when waitForAngular times out

This changes the default script timeout from 100 seconds down to 11. Tests
which relied on extremely long timeouts will need to change the default script
timeout with `driver.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(<bigNumber>)`.

# 0.9.0

_Note: Major version 0 releases are for initial development, and backwards incompatible changes may be introduced at any time._

## Features

- ([0e8de99](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/0e8de99eb0d8a0db4f6d3538dd051c94f35775f5)) Wrap WebElements with Protractor specific features. This change allows
chained findElement calls to work with Protractor locators. It also
adds a function, evaluate, to evaluate an angular expression in the context
of a WebElement's scope.

- ([9f53118](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/9f5311812cbae5122ce2c6ebe522132273b0ebcc)) Improving the command line interface (adding more options). This allows
the --spec option to be passed with test files that will be resolved
relative to the current directory. Smarter merging of default config
values. Closes #65.

- ([73821fb](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/73821fb6b6d252a93cc15ce990b4ec4738b87b95)) Adding an 'ignoreSynchronization' property to turn off Protractor's attempt to
wait for Angular to be ready on a page. This can be used to test pages that
poll with $timeout or $http.

## Bug fixes

- ([cfc6438](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/cfc6438e80e77387afae776f289cd55813e9b2d9)) Adding support for isElementPresent with Protractor locators.
Closes #11.

- ([8329b01](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/8329b01865074c32f7a261fe9bbf2c151b704a34)) Adding waitForAngular calls before WebElement functions. Closes #37.

# 0.8.0

_Note: Major version 0 releases are for initial development, and backwards incompatible changes may be introduced at any time._

## Docs
- Added documentation to the [docs folder](https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/master/docs).

- ([08ef244](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/08ef244217fb83206c818c84cbe8f07999116ee3)) Adding debugging tests showing different types of timeouts, and fixing
a bug where scheduled tasks from a previous it block would run into
the next in case of a timeout.

## Features

- ([1c7eae0](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/1c7eae0c09f13b7068f81324f24967709e264241)) Updating the binary script to understand debug, so that
protractor debug conf.js works.

- ([7a59479](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/7a594791b5ac6616de9c98dcd7d44ecaffb0e8a3)) Adding a 'debug' function to protractor. This schedules a debugger pause
within the webdriver control flow.

- ([679c82d](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/679c82d510ea016690fba259db50b4afa36154cc)) Mixing in all webdriver exports to protractor. This means that webdriver
classes such as ActionSequence and Keys are accessible on the global
protractor.

- ([3c76246](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/3c76246a01e584bc30da645a36e75920b5397251)) Added nested angular app (ng-app on an element other than `<html>` or `<body>`) capability via conf file.

## Bug fixes

- ([1c9b98d](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/1c9b98d0464bbe57194cf340c6e5942cbe7c8385)) Fixed Sauce issues: low timeouts, shutdown and init order.

## Breaking Changes

- Now running selenium 2.25. Requires updating WebDriverJS and the selenium standalone binary and chromedriver binary.

- ([a54abfb](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/a54abfbbfd3b13be5144e64e52a267c73d409a81)) Spec paths in configuration files are now resolved from the location of the spec file instead of the current working directory when the command line is run.



# 0.7.0

_Note: Major version 0 releases are for initial development, and backwards incompatible changes may be introduced at any time._

## Features

- ([7966912](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/796691205795d93fe12c998d20a58c8220ac6fb7)) Updating to Selenium 2.24.

- ([90f0a94](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/90f0a942b09faff5924674a20ce7705b6d685eba)) Instead of having tests run with the protractor runner need to require()
the protractor library, publish it to the global namespace. This insures
the instance of protractor used within the tests is the same as the
one used on the command line. Closes #36. Version bump for incompatible
API changes.

- ([cb373c9](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/cb373c99a7e33c5514bf1d2728a64f631ec8784c)) Adding glob matching to the spec files from the config. Closes #29.


## Breaking changes

- Now running on selenium 2.24. Requires updating WebDriverJS and the selenium standalone binary.

- The protractor runner now publishes `protractor` to the global namespace and sets up the Jasmine-WebDriver adapter. Tests run with this should no longer include

````javascript
// var protractor = require('protractor'); // No longer needed!
// require('protractor/jasminewd'); // No longer needed!

var ptor = protractor.getInstance(); // This should just work now.
````
