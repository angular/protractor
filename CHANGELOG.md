## Breaking Changes

- ([34f0eeb](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/34f0eebd7e73b10e9b990caa06b63b6fd22b2589)) 
  fix(element): update to selenium-webdriver@2.45.1 and remove element.then

  This change updates the version of WebDriverJS (selenium-webdriver node module) from 2.44 to
  2.45.1. See the full changelog at 
  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/node/selenium-webdriver/CHANGES.md

  To enable the update and remove confusion, this removes the `element().then` function unless there
  is an action result. This function is completely unnecessary, because it would always resolve to
  itself, but the removal may cause breaking changes.

  Before:
  ```js
  element(by.css('foo')).then(function(el) {
    return el.getText().then(...);
  });
  ```

  After:
  ```js
  element(by.css('foo')).getText().then(...);
  ```

  In other words, an ElementFinder is now no longer a promise until an action has been called.

  Before:
  ```js
  var el = element(by.css('foo'));

  protractor.promise.isPromise(el); // true
  protractor.promise.isPromise(el.click()); // true
  ```

  After:
  ```js
  var el = element(by.css('foo'));

  protractor.promise.isPromise(el); // false
  protractor.promise.isPromise(el.click()); // true
  ```

  Also, fixes `filter` and `map` to work with the new WebDriverJS.

    framework: 'custom',
    frameworkPath: '/path/to/your/framework/index.js'
  }
  ```

- ([9bc1c53](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/9bc1c53e40161521b0c125a810f86235c974f100))

  var urlChanged = function() {
    return browser.getCurrentUrl().then(function(url) {
      return url != 'http://www.angularjs.org';
    });
  };

  // condition to wait for url to change, title to contain 'foo', and $('abc') element to contain text 'bar'
  var condition = EC.and(urlChanged, EC.titleContains('foo'),
      EC.textToBePresentInElement($('abc'), 'bar'));
  $('navButton').click(); browser.wait(condition, 5000); //wait for condition to be true.
  // do other things

  feat(runner): add browser.getProcessedConfig method

  Now, instances of the `browser` object have a `getProcessedConfig` method which returns a promise
  that resolves to the current Protractor configuration object for the current runner instance. This
  means that if multiCapabilities are being used or tests are sharded, `getProcessedConfig` will
  return an object with the `capabilities` and `specs` property specific to the current instance.

  Closes #1724

  feat(frameworks): add jasmine2 framework

  Jasmine2.x may now be used by setting `framework: jasmine2` in your config.
  See https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/jasmine-upgrade.md

- ([0b93003](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/0b930035905d1868225667de358222e51394f3ac)) 
  feat(jasmine2): add 'grep' option to jasmine2

  Allow users to filter the specs that they want to run using simple string match. To use this
  feature, either: 1) specify jasmineNodeOpts.grep in your conf.js file
   or 2) via commandline like "protractor conf.js --grep='pattern to match'"

  usage.

- ([9c9ed31](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/9c9ed31591f5a3c552222ad7feb1ecd650973902)) 
  feat(launcher): allow multicapabilities to take array of promises

  Enables adding `getMultiCapabilities: function(){}` to your configuration file. The function
  returns either multiCapabilities or a promise of a multiCapabilities that is resolved after
  `afterLaunch` and before driver set up. If this is specified, both capabilities and
  multiCapabilities will be ignored.

  Also allows specifying `seleniumAddress` in the capabilities/multiCapabilities object, which will
  override the global `seleniumAddress`. This allows you to use a different `seleniumAddress` per
  capabilities.

  Breaking Changes:
  `capabilities` can no longer be a promise. Use getMultiCapabilities if you need to return a
  promise.
  `seleniumAddress` can no longer be a promise. Likewise, use getMultiCapabilities.

  feat(protractor): add browser.getRegisteredMockModules()

  Now `browser.getRegisteredMockModules()` returns a list of the functions or strings that have
  been registered as mock modules. For troubleshooting.

  Closes #1434.

- ([5a404c2](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/5a404c27326fdb130e5d4ac5c4704b4013c78853)) 
  feat(timeline): add timeline plugin

  This plugin gathers test timeline information from the protractor test process, the selenium
  client logs (if available), and sauce labs (if available), and presents the output visually. This
  improves understanding of where latency issues are in tests. See #674

  Usage:

  Add the plugin to your configuration file:

  ```js
  exports.config = {
   plugins: [{
     path: 'node_modules/protractor/plugins/timeline/index.js',

      // Output json and html will go in this folder.
     outdir: 'timelines',

      // Optional - if sauceUser and sauceKey are specified, logs from
     // SauceLabs will also be parsed after test invocation.
       sauceUser: 'Jane',
       sauceKey: 'abcdefg'
     }],
   // other configuration settings
  };
  ```

  feat(plugins): add postResults hook for plugins

  Allows plugins to include a postResults function, which will be called after webdriver has been
  quit and the environment has been torn down. This step may not modify the contents of the test
  results object.

  fix(waitforangular): improve error messages when waitForAngular fails

  Previously, caught errors were being interpreted as an empty object, causing lots of errors such
  as
  'Uncaught exception: Error while waiting for Protractor to sync with the page: {}' Now the error
  message will be displayed, and a more useful custom message will be thrown if the variable
  'angular' is not present or the root element is not part of the ng-app.

  See #1474

## Breaking Changes

- Due to ([9c9ed31](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/9c9ed31591f5a3c552222ad7feb1ecd650973902)) 
  feat(launcher): allow multicapabilities to take array of promises

  Breaking Changes:
  `capabilities` can no longer be a promise. Use getMultiCapabilities if you need to return a
  promise.
  `seleniumAddress` can no longer be a promise. Likewise, use getMultiCapabilities.

  Why is this breaking change not causing a major version bump? This feature was
  not fully supported previously and we worked with all known users when making
  the change.

  fix(element): use the root element only to find the testability API, not scope searches

  In 9a8f45a a change was introduced which made Protractor's custom locators (by.binding, by.model,
  etc) use config.rootElement as the root for all their searches. This meant that
  config.rootElement was used both to specify how to get hold of Angular's injector as well as
  where to begin searching for elements. This does not work for all cases, for example if a dialog 
  should be searched for elements but is a sibling, not a child, of ng-app.

  This reverts that change, and uses document as the parent for all searches. This is consistent
  with the behavior of the native locators by.id, by.css, and friends, which do not scope their

  chore(angular): upgrade angular to version 1.3.

  This change updates Protractor's test application from 1.2.9 to 1.3.0-r0.

  There is a significant behind-the-scenes change in the implementation of locating elements and
  waiting for the page to be stable. If you are updating your application to Angular 1.3, you may
  run into some changes you will need to make in your tests:

   - `by.binding` no longer allows using the surrounding `{{}}`. Previously, these
     were optional.
     Before: `var el = element(by.binding('{{foo}}'))`
     After: `var el = element(by.binding('foo'))`

   - Prefixes `ng_` and `x-ng-` are no longer allowed for models. Use `ng-model`.

   - `by.repeater` cannot find elements by row and column which are not children
    of the row. For example, if your template is
    `<div ng-repeat="foo in foos">{{foo.name}}</div>`
    Before: `var el = element(by.repeater('foo in foos').row(2).column('foo.name'))`
    After: You may either enclose `{{foo.name}}` in a child element or simply use:
    `var el = element(by.repeater('foo in foos').row(2))`

  Previously, locators used 'document' as the root for their search. After this change, they will

  on one page, and also enables the getTestability path, because that requires a root element under
  an ng-app.

  fix(protractor) fix stack traces for WebElement errors

  When angular/protractor@3c0e727136ab3d397c1a9a2bb02692d0aeb9be40 refactored `element()` into the
  ElementFinder object, the function lost some of its error handling.  This removed references to
  frames inside tests (`it()` blocks), making it hard to tell where the error was actually
  occurring.

  This commit fixes these problems, showing full stack traces for WebElement errors.

  timeout for one particular `get` call by using a second parameter:
  `browser.get(url, timeout_in_sec)`

  (e.g. This is the common case when running dart2js code.  This commit gives us the Dart stack
  trace and exception message.)

  In addition, I've pushed the construction of the string to install into the browser into
  clientsidescripts.js.

  fix(locators): fix by.repeater finding all rows for IE

  Previously, element.all(by.repeater('foo in foos')) would find non-element nodes for
  ng-repeat-start elements, which could cause IEDriver to fall over if the test tried to get text
  from those nodes.

## Breaking Changes

- ([3c0e727](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/3c0e727136ab3d397c1a9a2bb02692d0aeb9be40)) 
  refactor(protractor): reorganize internal structure of elementFinder/webelement

  - Allow chaining of actions (i.e. `element(By.x).clear().sendKeys('abc')`)
  - first(), last(), and get(index) are not executed immediately, allowing
      them to be placed in page objects
  - Rework the way that elementFinder and wrappedWebElement is represented
  - Breaking changes:
    - element.all is chained differently
        ```
        Before: element(By.x).element.all(By.y)
        Now:    element(By.x).all(By.y)
        
        However, using element.all without chaining did not change,
          i.e. `element.all(By.x)`
        ```

    - Changed the way for retrieving underlying webElements
        ```
        Before: element(By.x).find(), element(By.x).findElement(By.y),
                  and element(By.x).findElements(By.y)
        Now:    element(By.x).getWebElement(),
                  element(By.x).element(By.y).getWebElement(),
                  and element(By.x).element(By.y).getWebElements(),
                  respectively
        ```
    - browser.findElement returns a raw WebElement so $, $$, and
        evaluate will no longer be available

  feat(launcher): Add support for maxSession

  - add support for maxSession and capability-specific specs
  - cleaned up launcher (refactored out taskScheduler.js)
  - Breaking change:
    - changed the config to shard test files; also sharding is specific to
  capabilities now
      ```
      Before: config.splitTestsBetweenCapabilities
      Now: config.capabilities.shardTestFiles or config.multiCapabilities[index].shardTestFiles
      ```

- ([9e5d9e4](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/9e5d9e4abb7d0928e6092a711fda527554994be7)) 
  feat(locators): remove deprecated locator APIs

  This is a **breaking change**. The following deprecated Locator APIs have been removed.

  - `by.input`
  - `by.select`
  - `by.selectedOption`
  - `by.textarea`

  `input`, `select`, and `textarea` can be replaced by `by.model`.

  `element(by.selectedOption('foo'))` can be replaced by
  `element(by.model('foo')).$('option:checked')`

  the command line you use to start the test. Once paused, you can step forward, pausing before
  each webdriver command, and interact with the browser. Exit the debugger to continue the tests.

## Breaking Changes
- ([05eb42b](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/05eb42bb482c7cb36b48af1a86210afc442aa112)) 
  refactor(locators): moves scope in locators to last argument

  scope defaults to document, and is an optional argument so now be moved to the end. Came up from
  debugging and trying to use window.clientSideScripts.findInputs('username'); which failed.
  Refactored to match original intent.

  BREAKING CHANGE: anything relying on clientsidescripts should no longer pass
     element scope as first argument.

      Before:

      window.clientSideScripts.findInputs(document, 'username');

      After:

      window.clientSideScripts.findInputs('username', document);
      // or simply
      window.clientSideScripts.findInputs('username');

    Also, any custom locators using addLocator will now break since the
    arguments order has changed. To migrate the code follow the example below:

      Before:

      var findMenuItem = function() {
        var domScope = arguments[0];
        var myArg = arguments[1];
        // balh blah blah
      };
      by.addLocator('menuItem', findMenuItem);

      After:

      var findMenuItem = function() {
        var myArg = arguments[0];
        var domScope = arguments[1];
        // balh blah blah
      };

  feat(runner): add beta support for using mocha as your test framework

  This change adds limited support for using mocha as the test framework instead of jasmine. Make
  the switch by using `--framework=mocha` on the command line or adding `framework: 'mocha'` to the
  config. Tests will be run using the BDD interface. The interface is adapted so that tests run
  asynchronously without needing to call `done()`.

  Note that there is currently no support for an assertion framework, so you will need to require
  whichever assertion framework you prefer. This means there is no adapter to make the assertions
  unwrap promises, so you will need to resolve promises yourself and run the assertions afterwards.

  feat(runner): add beta support for using mocha as your test framework

  To allow the user to customize their framework, the protractor runner will now wait
  until just before `onPrepare` to load the framework. This means that `jasmine` will
  not be available in global until `onPrepare`. For example, this means that requiring
  the jasmine-reporters module must be done inside onPrepare, since that module expects
  jasmine to be available at the time it is loaded.

  Breaking Change.
  As outlined in Issue #296, redoing the way the selenium/webdriver
  install and run helper scripts work. Now, the 'webdriver-manager' script
  will be available either locally or globally (depending on how protractor
  was installed). It replaced install_selenium_standalone and the 'start' script
  that was provided after install. Run `webdriver-manager update` to download
  new versions of selected webdriver binaries. Run `webdriver-manager start`
  to start the standalone server. In addition, this fixes issues with running
  the server starter in Windows, and allows automated downloading of the IEDriver.

  Thanks to kurthong and vipper for their PRs with windows fixes, which were
  very useful in preparing this.

  When errors with messages matching /timeout/ were created, Protractor
  clears the control flow so that the remainder of the tasks scheduled
  for that spec don't bleed over into the next spec. This was messing up
  the promises used in the runner, since they are also webdriver promises.
  Long term, the runner should _not_ use webdriver promises. For now, fix by
  having the runner resolve promises directly rather than through chaining,
  and add a TODO to use promises which aren't connected to WebDriver's
  control flow in the runner.

In an effort to make tests more readable and clear, a few more global variables
will now be exported.

`browser` is an instance of protractor. This was previously accessed using

`by` is a collection of element locators. Previously, this was `protractor.By`.

`$` is a shortcut for getting elements by css. `$('.foo')` === `element(by.css('.foo'))`

elements with protractor specific functionality.

- ([c17ac12](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/c17ac12c2a213a7b6f8c236e81ba5cb2db542fd0)) fix(cli): allow running from command line without a config file

If all necessary fields are specified (e.g. seleniumAddress and at least
one spec), a config file shouldn't be necessary.

## Breaking Changes

- ([421d623](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/421d6232fe0b45ca1758afd634997da644f2e1db)) fix(repeat): use 0-based indexing for repeater rows

BREAKING CHANGE: Finding rows with protractor.By.repeater now
indexes from 0 instead of 1. This should be more familiar to most
modern programmers. You will need to edit existing tests. Closes #90.

Before:
```
// The fourth foo
ptor.findElement(protractor.By.repeater('foo in foos').row(4));
```
After:
```
// The fourth foo
ptor.findElement(protractor.By.repeater('foo in foos').row(3));
```

## Features

- ([881759e](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/881759e77462dc8e1001eb77008668ae6dc552cd)) feat(timeouts): add a unique error message when waitForAngular times out

To improve the readability of error messages, when waitForAngular times out
it now produces a custom message. This should help clarify confusion
for pages that continually poll using $interval. This change also adds more
documentation on timeouts. See issue #109.

- ([37e0f1a](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/37e0f1af196c3c0bf54dcddf0088a8c16602e5f2)) feat(install selenium): better communication in the install script

Adds better messages in the selenium server install script, and also
makes the script output a 'start' executable which can be used to quickly
start up the selenium standalone. *not yet windows friendly*. Closes #108.

- ([b32f5a5](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/b32f5a59169f1324271bd5abc09c17fcd9c4f249)) feat(config): add examples for dealing with log-in

Adds examples for how to log in when the login page is not written
in Angular. New examples are in spec/login.

- ([1b7675a](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/1b7675aab7846bee54117876887bfec07ce31745)) feat(cli): add an onPrepare callback to the config

This onPrepare callback is useful when you want to do something with
protractor before running the specs. For example, you might want
to monkey-patch protractor with custom functions used by all the
specs, or add the protractor instance to the globals.
An example usage is shown in the spec/onPrepareConf.js file and its
associated spec.

## Bug fixes

- ([256b21c](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/256b21cf8c744a200892e6b7f9172150b2f4fe8d)) fix(cli): allow passing the config file before the options

The cli usage says:
> USAGE: protractor configFile [options]
However, the options passed as argument are merged into the default
configuration as soon as the configFile is met in the args parsing
loop.
This fix merges the options in the default configuration only after
the loop, allowing to pass the options to the cli before or after,
or around the config file.

- ([6223825](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/62238252c7fc68c6a5941883f6a272e95997a8ff)) fix(jasminewd): allow use of custom matchers

Using jasmine.Matchers.prototype to generate the chained methods for
expect() calls is flawed because it does not pick up custom matchers
defined using addMatcher.  Instead, use either the matchersClass for
the current spec or from the environment.

- ([c22fc38](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/c22fc387bc0ef7a07371e023d39a6ce58dfa56c9)) fix(sync): getCurrentUrl and friends should sync with Angular first

getCurrentUrl, getPageSource, and getTitle should sync with Angular
before executing. Closes #92.

- ([dd06756](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/dd067561cf9fe0a765e98605b9ebdd8fbfef04d3)) fix(clientsidescripts): findElements and isElementPresent for protractor.By.select

- ([c607459](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/c60745945c6514e25403783eab3de5873e15758b)) fix (navigation): The defer label should appear before other window names,
not after.

- ([806f381](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/806f38113c675a26171776a559a20bf3899aa2cc)) Fix: findElements() and isElementPresent() now work for protractor.By.input.
Closes #79.

## Breaking changes

- ([881759e](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/881759e77462dc8e1001eb77008668ae6dc552cd)) feat(timeouts): add a unique error message when waitForAngular times out

This changes the default script timeout from 100 seconds down to 11. Tests
which relied on extremely long timeouts will need to change the default script
timeout with `driver.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(<bigNumber>)`.

# 0.9.0

_Note: Major version 0 releases are for initial development, and backwards incompatible changes may be introduced at any time._

## Features

- ([0e8de99](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/0e8de99eb0d8a0db4f6d3538dd051c94f35775f5)) Wrap WebElements with Protractor specific features. This change allows
chained findElement calls to work with Protractor locators. It also
adds a function, evaluate, to evaluate an angular expression in the context
of a WebElement's scope.

- ([9f53118](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/9f5311812cbae5122ce2c6ebe522132273b0ebcc)) Improving the command line interface (adding more options). This allows
the --spec option to be passed with test files that will be resolved
relative to the current directory. Smarter merging of default config
values. Closes #65.

- ([73821fb](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/73821fb6b6d252a93cc15ce990b4ec4738b87b95)) Adding an 'ignoreSynchronization' property to turn off Protractor's attempt to
wait for Angular to be ready on a page. This can be used to test pages that
poll with $timeout or $http.

## Bug fixes

- ([cfc6438](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/cfc6438e80e77387afae776f289cd55813e9b2d9)) Adding support for isElementPresent with Protractor locators.
Closes #11.

- ([8329b01](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/8329b01865074c32f7a261fe9bbf2c151b704a34)) Adding waitForAngular calls before WebElement functions. Closes #37.

# 0.8.0

_Note: Major version 0 releases are for initial development, and backwards incompatible changes may be introduced at any time._

## Docs
- Added documentation to the [docs folder](https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/master/docs).

- ([08ef244](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/08ef244217fb83206c818c84cbe8f07999116ee3)) Adding debugging tests showing different types of timeouts, and fixing
a bug where scheduled tasks from a previous it block would run into
the next in case of a timeout.

## Features

- ([1c7eae0](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/1c7eae0c09f13b7068f81324f24967709e264241)) Updating the binary script to understand debug, so that
protractor debug conf.js works.

- ([7a59479](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/7a594791b5ac6616de9c98dcd7d44ecaffb0e8a3)) Adding a 'debug' function to protractor. This schedules a debugger pause
within the webdriver control flow.

- ([679c82d](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/679c82d510ea016690fba259db50b4afa36154cc)) Mixing in all webdriver exports to protractor. This means that webdriver
classes such as ActionSequence and Keys are accessible on the global
protractor.

- ([3c76246](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/3c76246a01e584bc30da645a36e75920b5397251)) Added nested angular app (ng-app on an element other than `<html>` or `<body>`) capability via conf file.

## Bug fixes

- ([1c9b98d](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/1c9b98d0464bbe57194cf340c6e5942cbe7c8385)) Fixed Sauce issues: low timeouts, shutdown and init order.

## Breaking Changes

- Now running selenium 2.25. Requires updating WebDriverJS and the selenium standalone binary and chromedriver binary.

- ([a54abfb](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/a54abfbbfd3b13be5144e64e52a267c73d409a81)) Spec paths in configuration files are now resolved from the location of the spec file instead of the current working directory when the command line is run.



# 0.7.0

_Note: Major version 0 releases are for initial development, and backwards incompatible changes may be introduced at any time._

## Features

- ([7966912](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/796691205795d93fe12c998d20a58c8220ac6fb7)) Updating to Selenium 2.24.

- ([90f0a94](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/90f0a942b09faff5924674a20ce7705b6d685eba)) Instead of having tests run with the protractor runner need to require()
the protractor library, publish it to the global namespace. This insures
the instance of protractor used within the tests is the same as the
one used on the command line. Closes #36. Version bump for incompatible
API changes.

- ([cb373c9](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/cb373c99a7e33c5514bf1d2728a64f631ec8784c)) Adding glob matching to the spec files from the config. Closes #29.


## Breaking changes

- Now running on selenium 2.24. Requires updating WebDriverJS and the selenium standalone binary.

- The protractor runner now publishes `protractor` to the global namespace and sets up the Jasmine-WebDriver adapter. Tests run with this should no longer include

````javascript
// var protractor = require('protractor'); // No longer needed!
// require('protractor/jasminewd'); // No longer needed!

var ptor = protractor.getInstance(); // This should just work now.
````
