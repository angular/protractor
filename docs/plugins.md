Protractor Plugins
=================

Plugins extend Protractor's base features by using hooks during test
execution to gather more data and potentially modify the test output.

The Protractor API and available plugins are *BETA* and may change
without a major version bump.

The `plugins` folder contains default plugins for Protractor.

  * [Console Plugin](#console-plugin-chrome-only)

Using Plugins
-------------

Plugins are enabled via your config file.

```javascript
// protractor.conf.js
exports.config = {

  // ... the rest of your config

  plugins: [{
    // The only required field for each plugin is the path to that
    // plugin's entry script.
    // Paths are relative to location of the config file.
    path: 'path/to/plugin/index.js',

    // Plugins may use additional options specified here. See the
    // individual plugin docs for more information.
    option1: 'foo',
    option2: 'bar'
  }]
};
```

Protractor contains built in plugins in the 'plugins' folder. An example of
using the 'ngHint' plugin is shown below.

```javascript
  plugins: [{
    path: 'node_modules/protractor/plugins/ngHint',
  }]
```

If your plugin is a node module, you may use it with the `package` option. For
example, if you did `npm install example-protractor-plugin` your config would
look like:

```javascript
  plugins: [{
    package: 'example-protractor-plugin',
  }]
```

Finally, if you are writing a small plugin which will only be used by one config
file, you can write the plugin inline into the config:

```javascript
  plugins: [{
    inline: {
      setup: function() { ... },
      teardown: function() { ... },
      ...
    }
  }]
```

Writing Plugins
---------------

Plugins are designed to work with any test framework (Jasmine, Mocha, etc),
so they use generic hooks which Protractor provides. Plugins may change
the output of Protractor by returning a results object.

Plugins are node modules which export an object with the following API:

```js
/*
 * Sets up plugins before tests are run. This is called after the WebDriver
 * session has been started, but before the test framework has been set up.
 *
 * @param {Object} config The plugin configuration object. Note that
 *     this is not the entire Protractor config object, just the
 *     entry in the plugins array for this plugin.
 *
 * @return Object If an object is returned, it is merged with the Protractor
 *     result object. May return a promise.
 */
exports.setup = function(config) {};

/*
 * This is called after the tests have been run, but before the WebDriver
 * session has been terminated.
 *
 * @param {Object} config The plugin configuration object.
 *
 * @return Object If an object is returned, it is merged with the Protractor
 *     result object. May return a promise.
 */
exports.teardown = function(config) {};

/*
 * Called after the test results have been finalized and any jobs have been
 * updated (if applicable).
 *
 * @param {Object} config The plugin configuration object.
 *
 * @return Return values are ignored.
 */
exports.postResults = function(config) {};

/**
 * Called after each test block (in Jasmine, this means an `it` block)
 * completes.
 *
 * @param {Object} config The plugin configuration object.
 * @param {boolean} passed True if the test passed.
 * @param {Object} testInfo information about the test which just ran.
 *
 * @return Object If an object is returned, it is merged with the Protractor
 *     result object. May return a promise.
 */
exports.postTest = function(config, passed, testInfo) {};

/**
 * Used when reporting results.
 * @type {string}
 */
exports.name = '';
```

Each of these exported properties are totally optional.

The protractor results object follows the format specified in
the [Framework documentation](../lib/frameworks/README.md).

Accessibility Plugin
--------------------
Protractor comes with support for two accessibility testing options:
 * Accessibility Developer Tools
 * Tenon.io

Protractor will run each set of audits (depending on your configuration) on your existing end-to-end
tests to ensure your site is free of obvious errors. In this kind of testing, there is no concept of
"warnings"â€“only pass or fail. In your configuration, you can decide whether warnings should
pass or fail your build.

To understand how each of these tools can be used, see this support matrix:

| Testing Library                      | Pricing                                   | API Key | External Request | No. of Tests | Info                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chrome Accessibility Developer Tools | Free                                      | No      | No               | 14           | [Github](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/accessibility-developer-tools) |
| Tenon.io                             | Free limited accounts, paid subscriptions | Yes     | Yes              | 63           | [Tenon.io](http://tenon.io/)                                            |

Protractor now supports the [Accessibility Developer Tools](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/accessibility-developer-tools), the same audit library used by the [Chrome browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?hl=en). Protractor
[runs an audit](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/accessibility-developer-tools/wiki/Audit-Rules)
locally by injecting the Dev Tools script into WebDriver pages, and it can diagnose issues including
missing labels, incorrect ARIA attributes and color contrast. This is a great starting point if
you can't send source code over the wire through an API.

[Tenon.io](http://www.tenon.io) has a more robust set of tests to help you find
accessibility issues, but it requires [registering](http://tenon.io/register.php) for an API key
and making an external request for each test, which may not work for everyone. Some people use
Tenon with introspection services like ngrok or localtunnel to securely
test local web servers. Protractor takes the [options you provide](http://tenon.io/documentation/understanding-request-parameters.php) in the plugin configuration and sends them
with the page source to the Tenon API. One limitation of this approach is that all scripts must be reachable from the page source as a string, for example, by using a CDN.
For projects with an MIT license, Tenon is free but with a limited
daily API limit. Paid subscriptions are available for enterprise and commercial projects.

Enable this plugin in your config file:
```js
  // Chrome Accessibility Dev Tools only:
  exports.config = {
      ...
      plugins: [{
        chromeA11YDevTools: {
          treatWarningsAsFailures: true
        },
        path: 'node_modules/protractor.plugins/accessiblity'
      }]
    }
```
```js
  // Tenon.io only:
  exports.config = {
      ...
      plugins: [{
        tenonIO: {
          options: {
            // See http://tenon.io/documentation/understanding-request-parameters.php
            // options.src will be added by the test.
          },
          printAll: false, // whether the plugin should log API response
        },
        chromeA11YDevTools: true,
        path: 'node_modules/protractor/plugins/accessiblity'
      }]
    }
```

ngHint Plugin
-------------
ngHint adds run-time hinting to AngularJS projects. This plugin bubbles those hints up to the
command line so they can be used in automated testing.

You enable this plugin in your config file:
 ```js
exports.config = {
  plugins: [{
    path: 'node_modules/protractor/plugins/ngHint',

    asTests: {Boolean},
    excludeURLs: {(String|RegExp)[]}
  }]
};
```
`asTests` specifies if the plugin should generate passed/failed test results
based on the ngHint output or instead log the results to the console.
Defaults to true.

`excludeURLs` specifies a list of URLs for which ngHint results should be
ignored. Defaults to []

Timeline Plugin
---------------
This plugin gathers test timeline information from the protractor test process, the selenium
client logs (if available), and sauce labs (if available), and presents the output visually.
This improves understanding of where latency issues are in tests.

To enable the Timeline plugin, set it up in your config file:
```js
exports.config = {
  plugins: [{
   path: 'node_modules/protractor/plugins/timeline/index.js',

    // Output json and html will go in this folder.
   outdir: 'timelines',

    // Optional - if sauceUser and sauceKey are specified, logs from
   // SauceLabs will also be parsed after test invocation.
     sauceUser: 'Jane',
     sauceKey: 'abcdefg'
   }],
  // other configuration settings
};
```


Console Plugin (Chrome only)
----------------------------

This plugin checks the browser log after each test for warnings and errors.  It
can be configured to fail a test if either is detected.  There is also an
optional exclude parameter which accepts both regex and strings.  Any log
matching the exclude parameter will not fail the test or be logged to the
console.
 
```js
exports.config = {
  plugins: [{
    path: 'node_modules/protractor/plugins/console',
    failOnWarning: {Boolean}                (Default - false),
    failOnError: {Boolean}                  (Default - true)
    exclude: {Array of strings and regex}   (Default - [])
  }]
};
```

Note that this plugin's behavior is undefined on browsers other than Chrome.
Firefox users have reported flaky results.
