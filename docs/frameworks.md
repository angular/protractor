Choosing a Framework
====================

Protractor supports two behavior driven development (BDD) test frameworks out of the box: Jasmine and Mocha. These frameworks are based on JavaScript and Node.js and provide the syntax, scaffolding, and reporting tools you will use to write and manage your tests.


Using Jasmine
-------------

Currently, Jasmine Version 2.x is supported and the default test framework when you install Protractor. For more information about Jasmine, see the [Jasmine GitHub site](http://jasmine.github.io/). For more information regarding how to upgrade to Jasmine 2.x from 1.3, see the [Jasmine upgrade guide](/docs/jasmine-upgrade.md).


Using Mocha
-----------

_Note: Limited support for Mocha is available as of December 2013. For more information, see the [Mocha documentation site](http://mochajs.org/)._

If you would like to use the Mocha test framework, you'll need to use the BDD interface and Chai assertions with [Chai As Promised](http://chaijs.com/plugins/chai-as-promised).

Download the dependencies with npm. Mocha should be installed in the same place as Protractor - so if protractor was installed globally, install Mocha with -g.

```
npm install -g mocha
npm install chai
npm install chai-as-promised
```

You will need to require and set up Chai inside your test files:

```js
var chai = require('chai');
var chaiAsPromised = require('chai-as-promised');

chai.use(chaiAsPromised);
var expect = chai.expect;
```

You can then use Chai As Promised as such:

```js
expect(myElement.getText()).to.eventually.equal('some text');
```

Finally, set the 'framework' property to 'mocha', either by adding `framework: 'mocha'` to the config file or by adding `--framework=mocha` to the command line.

Options for Mocha such as 'reporter' and 'slow' can be given in the [config file](../spec/mochaConf.js) with mochaOpts:

```js
mochaOpts: {
  reporter: "spec",
  slow: 3000
}
```

For a full example, see Protractorâ€™s own test: [/spec/mocha/lib_spec.js](/spec/mocha/lib_spec.js).


Using Cucumber
--------------

_Note: Cucumber is no longer included by default as of version `3.0`. You can integrate Cucumber with Protractor with the `custom` framework option. For more information, see the [Protractor Cucumber Framework site](https://github.com/mattfritz/protractor-cucumber-framework) or the [Cucumber GitHub site](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js)._


If you would  like to use the Cucumber test framework, download the dependencies with npm. Cucumber should be installed in the same place as Protractor - so if protractor was installed globally, install Cucumber with -g.

```
npm install -g cucumber
npm install --save-dev protractor-cucumber-framework
```

Set the 'framework' property to custom by adding `framework: 'custom'` and `frameworkPath: 'protractor-cucumber-framework'` to the [config file](../spec/cucumberConf.js)

Options for Cucumber such as 'format' can be given in the config file with cucumberOpts:

```js
exports.config = {
  // set to "custom" instead of cucumber.
  framework: 'custom',

  // path relative to the current config file
  frameworkPath: 'protractor-cucumber-framework'

  // relevant cucumber command line options
  cucumberOpts: {
    format: "summary"
  }
};
```

Using a Custom Framework
