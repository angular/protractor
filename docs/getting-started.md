Getting Started
===============

This guide describes how to get started writing Protractor tests.

Understand that Protractor wraps WebDriverJS
--------------------------------------------

When writing tests, it's important to remember that Protractor is a wrapper
around [WebDriverJS](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs). It's
highly recommended to skim the intro to WebDriverJS before starting with
protractor.

Selenium-Webdriver is a browser automation framework. Tests are written
with the WebDriver API, which communicates with a Selenium server to control
the browser under test.

When writing tests, keep the following in mind:

-  The test code and scripts running in the browser are separated, and only
   communicate through the [WebDriver wire protocol](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol).
-  WebDriver commands are scheduled on a control flow and return promises, not
   primitive values. See the [control flow doc](/docs/control-flow.md) for more
   info.
-  To run tests, WebDriverJS needs to talk to a selenium standalone server
   running as a separate process.

Setup and Config
----------------

Install Protractor with

    npm install -g protractor

(or omit the -g if you'd prefer not to install globally).

The example test expects a selenium standalone server to be running at
localhost:4444. Protractor comes with a script to help download and install
the standalone server. Run

    webdriver-manager update

This installs selenium standalone server and chromedriver to `protractor/selenium`. Start the server with

    webdriver-manager start

Protractor is now available as a command line program which takes one argument,
a configuration file.

    protractor node_modules/protractor/example/conf.js

The configuration file tells Protractor what tests to run, how to connect to a
webdriver server, and various other options for reporting. See
[referenceConf.js](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/referenceConf.js)
for an example and explanation of the options. This simple configuration is

```javascript
// An example configuration file.
exports.config = {
  // The address of a running selenium server.
  seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',

  // Capabilities to be passed to the webdriver instance.
  capabilities: {
    'browserName': 'chrome'
  },

  // Spec patterns are relative to the location of the spec file. They may
  // include glob patterns.
  specs: ['example-spec.js'],

  // Options to be passed to Jasmine-node.
  jasmineNodeOpts: {
    showColors: true, // Use colors in the command line report.
  }
};
```

Writing tests
-------------

By default, Protractor uses [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) as its
test scaffolding. ([read about using mocha instead](https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/master/docs/using-mocha.md)) Protractor exposes several global variables.

 * `browser` this is the a wrapper around an instance of webdriver. Used for
 navigation and page-wide information.

 * `element` is a helper function for finding and interacting with elements
 on the page you are testing.

 * `by` is a collection of element locator strategies. For example, elements
 can be found by CSS selector, by ID, or by the attribute they are bound to with
 ng-model.

 * `protractor` is the protractor namespace which wraps the webdriver namespace.
 This contains static variables and classes, such as `protractor.Key` which
 enumerates the codes for special keyboard signals.

Take this example, which tests the 'Basics' example on the AngularJS homepage:

```javascript
describe('angularjs homepage', function() {
  it('should greet the named user', function() {
    // Load the AngularJS homepage.
    browser.get('http://www.angularjs.org');

    // Find the element with ng-model matching 'yourName' - this will
    // find the <input type="text" ng-model="yourName"/> element - and then
    // type 'Julie' into it.
    element(by.model('yourName')).sendKeys('Julie');

    // Find the element with binding matching 'yourName' - this will
    // find the <h1>Hello {{yourName}}!</h1> element.
    var greeting = element(by.binding('yourName'));

    // Assert that the text element has the expected value.
    // Protractor patches 'expect' to understand promises.
    expect(greeting.getText()).toEqual('Hello Julie!');
  });
});

```

The `browser.get` method loads a page. Protractor expects Angular to be present on a page, so it will throw an error if the page it is attempting to load does
not contain the Angular library. (If you need to interact with a non-Angular
page, you may access the wrapped webdriver instance directly with
`browser.driver`).

The `element` method searches for an element on the page. It requires one
parameter, a *locator* strategy for locating the element. Protractor offers Angular specific strategies:

-  `by.binding` searches for elements by matching binding names,
   either from `ng-bind` or `{{}}` notation in the template.
-  `by.model` searches for elements by input `ng-model`.
-  `by.repeater` searches for `ng-repeat` elements. For example,
   `by.repeater('phone in phones').row(11).column('price')` returns
   the element in the 12th row (0-based) of the `ng-repeat = "phone in phones"` repeater
   with the binding matching `{{phone.price}}`.

You may also use plain old WebDriver strategies such as `by.id` and
`by.css`. Since locating by CSS selector is so common, the global variable `$` is an alias for `element.by.css`.

`element` returns an ElementFinder. This is an object which allows you to interact with the element on your page, but since all interaction with the browser must be done over webdriver, it is important to remember that this is *not* a DOM element. You can interact with it with methods such as
`sendKeys`, `getText`, and `click`. Check out the [API](/docs/api.md) for a list of
all available methods.

See Protractor's [findelements test suite](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/spec/basic/findelements_spec.js)
for more examples.


Setting up the System Under Test
--------------------------------

Protractor uses real browsers to run its tests, so it can connect to anything that your browser can connect to. This means you have great flexibility in deciding _what_ you are actually testing. It could be a development server on localhost, a staging server up on your local network, or even production servers on the general internet. All Protractor needs is the URL.

There are a couple of things to watch out for!

**If your page does manual bootstrap** Protractor will not be able to load your page using `browser.get`. Instead, use the base webdriver instance - `browser.driver.get`. This means that Protractor does not know when your page is fully loaded, and you may need to add a wait statement to make sure your tests avoid race conditions.

**If your page uses $timeout for polling** Protractor will not be able to tell when your page is ready. Consider using $interval instead of $timeout and see [this issue](https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/49) for further discussion.

If you need to do global preparation for your tests (for example, logging in), you can put this into the config in the `onPrepare` property. This property can be either a function or a filename. If a filename, Protractor will load that file with node.js and run its contents. See the [login tests](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/spec/login) for an example.


Organizing Real Tests: Page Objects
-----------------------------------

When writing real tests scripts for your page, it's best to use the [Page Objects](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects) pattern to make your tests more readable. In Protractor, this could look like:

```javascript
var AngularHomepage = function() {
  this.nameInput = element(by.model('yourName'));
  this.greeting = element(by.binding('yourName'));

  this.get = function() {
    browser.get('http://www.angularjs.org');
  };

  this.setName = function(name) {
    this.nameInput.sendKeys(name);
  };
};
```

Your test then becomes:

```javascript
describe('angularjs homepage', function() {
  it('should greet the named user', function() {
    var angularHomepage = new AngularHomepage();
    angularHomepage.get();

    angularHomepage.setName('Julie');

    expect(angularHomepage.greeting.getText()).toEqual('Hello Julie!');
  });
});
```

It is possible to separate your tests in various test suites. The configuration becomes:

```javascript
// An example configuration file.
exports.config = {
  // The address of a running selenium server.
  seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',

  // Capabilities to be passed to the webdriver instance.
  capabilities: {
    'browserName': 'chrome'
  },

  // Spec patterns are relative to the location of the spec file. They may
  // include glob patterns.
  suites: {
    homepage: 'tests/e2e/homepage/**/*Spec.js',
    search: ['tests/e2e/contact_search/**/*Spec.js', 'tests/e2e/venue_search/**/*Spec.js']
  },

  // Options to be passed to Jasmine-node.
  jasmineNodeOpts: {
    showColors: true, // Use colors in the command line report.
  }
};
```

You can then easily switch from the command line between running one or the other
suite of tests:

    protractor protractor.conf.js --suite homepage

will only run the homepage section of the tests.
