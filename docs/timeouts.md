Timeouts
========

This file provides a reference for the various timeouts involved in a Protractor
test. Because WebDriver tests are asynchronous and there are many compoments
involved, there are many reasons a timeout may occur.

Timeouts from Protractor
------------------------

**Waiting for Page to Load**

When navigating to a new page using `browser.get`, Protractor waits for the page to
be loaded and the new URL to appear before continuing.

 - Looks like: an error in your test results - `Error: Timed out waiting for page to load after 10000ms`

 - Default timeout: 10 seconds

 - How to change: To change globally, add `getPageTimeout: timeout_in_millis` to your Protractor configuration file. For an individual call to `get`, pass an additional parameter: `browser.get(address, timeout_in_millis)`

**Waiting for Page Synchronization**

Before performing any action, Protractor asks Angular to wait until the page is synchronized. This means that all timeouts and http requests are finished. If your application continuously polls $timeout or $http, it will
never be registered as completely loaded. You should use the
[$interval service](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ng/interval.js) for anything that polls continuously (introduced in Angular 1.2rc3).

 - Looks like: an error in your test results - `Timed out waiting for Protractor to synchronize with the page after 11 seconds.`

 - Default timeout: 11 seconds

 - How to change: Add `allScriptsTimeout: timeout_in_millis` to your Protractor configuration file.

**Waiting for Angular**

Protractor only works with Angular applications, so it waits for the `angular` variable to be present when it is loading a new page.

 - Looks like: an error in your test results - `Angular could not be found on the page: retries looking for angular exceeded`

 - Default timeout: 10 seconds

 - How to change: To change globally, add `getPageTimeout: timeout_in_millis` to your Protractor configuration file. For an individual call to `get`, pass an additional parameter: `browser.get(address, timeout_in_millis)`


Timeouts from WebDriver
-----------------------

**Asynchronous Script Timeout**

Sets the amount of time to wait for an asynchronous script to finish execution before throwing an error.

 - Looks like: an error in your test results - `ScriptTimeoutError: asynchronous script timeout: result was not received in 11 seconds`

 - Default timeout: 11 seconds

 - How to change: Add `allScriptsTimeout: timeout_in_millis` to your Protractor configuration file.


Timeouts from Jasmine
---------------------

**Spec Timeout**

If a spec (an 'it' block) takes longer than the Jasmine timeout for any reason, it will fail.

 - Looks like: a failure in your test results - `timeout: timed out after 30000 msec waiting for spec to complete`

 - Default timeout: 30 seconds

 - How to change: To change for all specs, add `jasmineNodeOpts: {defaultTimeoutInterval: timeout_in_millis}` to your Protractor configuration file. To change for one individual spec, pass a third parameter to `it`: `it(description, testFn, timeout_in_millis)`.


Timeouts from Sauce Labs
------------------------
If you are using Sauce Labs, there are a couple additional ways your test can time out. See [Sauce Labs Timeout Documentation](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/test-configuration/#timeouts) for more information.

**Maximum Test Duration**

Sauce Labs limits the maximum total duration for a test

 - Looks like: `Test exceeded maximum duration after 1800 seconds`

 - Default timeout: 30 minutes

 - How to change: Edit the "max-duration" key in the capabilities object.

**Command Timeout**

As a safety measure to prevent Selenium crashes from making your tests run indefinitely, Sauce limits how long Selenium can take to run a command in browsers. This is set to 300 seconds by default.

 - Looks like: `Selenium took too long to run your command`

 - Default timeout: 300 seconds

 - How to change: Edit the "command-timeout" key in the capabilities object.

**Idle Timeout**

As a safety measure to prevent tests from running too long after something has gone wrong, Sauce limits how long a browser can wait for a test to send a new command. This is set to 90 seconds by default. You can adjust this limit on a per-job basis.

 - Looks like: `Test did not see a new command for 90 seconds. Timing out.`

 - Default timeout: 90 seconds

 - How to change: Edit the "idle-duration" key in the capabilities object.
